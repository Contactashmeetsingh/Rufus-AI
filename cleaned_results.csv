UC Merced offers the Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. New students are assigned a faculty advisor and committee that assist them in developing a curriculum to meet the requirements. Although considerable flexibility to meet individual needs exists, requirements usually include a core of required material that a student must master. The M.S. and M.A. degrees are either Plan I or Plan II programs. Plan I requires a minimum of 24 semester units in approved graduate courses plus completion of a thesis. Plan II requires at least 30 semester units in approved graduate courses, followed by a comprehensive examination administered by the faculty. Students pursuing M.S. or M.A. Plan I degrees will begin their thesis research at the end of the first year.

Fellowships are awarded primarily on the basis of merit and the promise of outstanding academic and professional achievement. Consideration is given to the extent and quality of previous undergraduate and graduate work, evidence of ability in research or other creative accomplishment, evidence of intellectual capacity and promise of productive scholarship. Financial need or the availability of other sources of support in your graduate program is not relevant to the evaluation of academic merit, but may be an additional criterion for some fellowships. Students must establish eligibility for need-based fellowships by filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). For faster and more accurate filing, students can complete the FAFSA online at Financial aid awards that require repayment, loans, offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. Some loan programs are based on financial need, but there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest loans. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans - Not based on financial need, these loans are available to all eligible students, regardless of income. This loan is “unsubsidized” in that the student is responsible for paying all interest due. There is no federal interest subsidy for the loan. Interest accrues immediately upon disbursement. Borrowers may elect to pay accrued interest on a monthly or quarterly basis or have it added back to the principal balance in a process called capitalization. PLUS Loans for Graduate and Professional Degree Students – Graduate and professional degree students are eligible to borrow under the PLUS Loan Program up to their cost of attendance minus other estimated financial assistance. The terms and conditions applicable to Parent PLUS Loans also apply to Graduate/Professional PLUS loans. These requirements include a determination that the applicant does not have an adverse credit history, repayment beginning on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Applicants for these loans are required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). They also must have applied for their annual loan maximum eligibility under the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program before applying for a Graduate/Professional PLUS loan. section under Financial Aid and Scholarships for more information on the academic requirements for student loans. General Requirements for Graduate Degrees Most requirements for graduate degree programs are determined by the Graduate Group that offers the degree. However, the Graduate Council, on behalf of the Academic Senate, has approval authority over all graduate programs on the Merced campus. Graduate students must complete a minimum of 4 units of letter-graded coursework, either upper division or graduate-level, at some point prior to receiving a graduate degree at UC Merced. If admitted for a second graduate degree, student will be held to all the usual degree requirements and University regulations pertaining to fees, examinations for advancement to candidacy, residency, etc. Courses already applied to any previously earned graduate degree cannot be applied toward the requirements of the second degree. In accordance with the policy approved by the Graduate Council, the Graduate Dean has delegated the authority to admit students for a second Master’s degree to the Graduate Groups. While official policy is to discourage duplication of degrees, graduate groups may allow more than one degree at the same level, including more than one academic or professional master’s. Admissions for a second Ph.D. is rarely granted and must be handled as an exception to policy and approved by the Graduate Dean. All requests must be made in writing to the Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Ph.D., as well as a statement assuring the Dean that the applicant’s first Ph.D. is an unrelated area and that there will be no duplication or waiving of coursework. Transfer of credit toward master’s degree requirements are governed by the University regulation and policy summarized in the Graduate Policies and Procedures Handbook. Courses taken toward a graduate degree at another institution cannot be transferred for credit toward a Ph.D. at UCM. However a course requirement may be waived if a similar course was taken at another institution."

Recipients are typically determined through a competitive application process based on academic achievement, financial need, and/or other criteria established by the donor. We also encourage students to apply for External Scholarships. Federal Student Loans – low-interest federal student loans that must be repaid with interest. Payments begin after the student graduates or drops below half-time enrollment. Federal Parent PLUS Loans – federal education loan allowing the parent to borrow on behalf of their student. The loans require a credit check, and mst be repaid with interest.

Jobs are available with flexible schedules that can be adjusted around each student’s classes. Money earned will not affect a student’s future financial aid eligibility) Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need and do not have to be repaid. The Federal Government provides funds for Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The State of California also offers Grants (A and B), Middle Class Scholarships (MCS), and Chafee Grant for Current or Former Foster Youth to qualified undergraduate students. In addition, institutional grant funds are provided by the University of California. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, applicants must be U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, be enrolled in an eligible undergraduate program, have not previously received a bachelor’s degree, and demonstrate financial need. The amount you receive depends on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as determined by completing the FAFSA, as well as your enrollment load. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) These are need-based grants provided to low-income undergraduate students to promote access to post-secondary education. Priority is given to students with exceptional financial need. To be eligible for a Cal Grant award, applicants must be California residents or meet the eligibility criteria for AB 540, demonstrate financial need and meet appropriate deadlines. The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) administers the Cal Grant program. Go to the CSAC website at awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant covers UC systemwide tuition and Student Service fees. Note: It does not cover campus-based fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. For first-year students, Cal Grant B provides a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. For students in their second through fourth years, it covers UC systemwide tuition and Student Service fees, plus a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. , if you are a Cal Grant recipient, in order to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. Eligibility is determined by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) and awards are determined by the campus. MCS applies to undergraduate students who do not qualify for the UC Blue & Gold Opportunity Program. Students whose families have income and assets up to $171,000 per year may be eligible for a scholarship of up to 40% of mandatory system-wide tuition and fees. Note: Eligibility for MCS will be reduced by the amount of other need-based aid applied to cover UC Systemwide tuition and Student Service Fees (e.g., Pell Grant, Cal Grant, Fee Waivers, institutional need-based aid such as Bobcat Grant, Scholarships, etc.). Awards are typically posted in early August. Eligibility is determined by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). This grant provides up to $5,000 a year for current or former foster youth.

Peterson Endowed Scholarship * Wells Fargo Scholarship for High School and Transfer Students Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment with interest. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. The State of California requires that students be told the following: Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning that the Department of Education provides the funding for this federal loan program. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school, but can defer any interest payment until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time working towards a degree. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. If the parent-borrower does not qualify for a PLUS Loan, they may either: Obtain an Endorser (i.e., another adult who is willing to co-sign the loan); or If the parent cannot locate an Endorser, the dependent student may then qualify to borrow additional Unsubsidized loan funds on their own. Undocumented students who graduate from a California high school and meet the CA Dream Act requirements are eligible for state and university aid; however, they are ineligible for federal aid including federal loans. The DREAM loan program aims to close that gap and provide eligible students with the opportunity to borrow student loans to help pay for their education. There is no interest or payments while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Alternative loans are funds available to students who are not eligible for financial aid or they need additional funds to meet their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance minus other financial aid or the annual loan maximum amount as determined by the lender. Because Alternative Loans are not guaranteed by the federal government, they must be insured privately. This extra cost is passed on to the borrower in the form of higher fees and interest rates. In addition, the lender will look at your credit history as well as other factors to determine if they will lend to you. You may be denied by one lender and approved by another because of the different ways the lender interprets your information. [How to apply] Please Note: Students should exhaust all federal student loan eligibility before borrowing private student loans. Students who are awarded a Federal Work-Study (FWS) award are given the opportunity to earn money by working part-time (i.e., up to 18 hours per week during an academic term) typically on-campus. Students are paid twice a month for the hours they work. This money may be used for any educationally related expenses that occur throughout the year. Students may only earn up to the amount they were awarded. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award on-line at: All FWS and non-FWS jobs are posted by Center for Career & Professional Advancement (CCPA) Office at Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the criteria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S.; be accepted for admission to the University; be enrolled at least half-time and in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted for financial aid purposes, with the exception of the Teacher Preparation Program); demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans); maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; be registered for the selective service if the student is a male and 18 to 25 years old, and is not currently on active duty with the armed forces; and not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Please note: Financial need is the difference between the Cost of Attendance (based on living on-campus, off-campus, or at home) and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Please note, if you are a Cal Grant recipient, in order to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. The Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards listed below apply to all aid applicants, whether aid was received for prior coursework. A student’s eligibility for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is affected by this policy. : In addition to the requirements listed below, all students, whether receiving aid or not, must also meet the university’s academic GPA standards established by the Registrar. Please refer to the Registrar’s website for these standards. 12 semesters or 6 years of FTE enrollment Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program 15 semesters or 7.5 years of FTE enrollment In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for financial aid eligibility, students must meet all three standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, and a maximum time-frame requirement. If a student fails to maintain SAP, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the SAP requirements; or if the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. A student who has financial aid eligibility reinstated as the result of an appeal is placed on an approved SAP Appeal and becomes subject to the terms of that Appeal. All work performed to regain eligibility under this SAP policy must be completed at UC Merced. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) will evaluate whether the student is adhering to the plan on a term-by-term basis. If the student has made up all deficiencies, he or she will no longer be considered on Appeal and instead will be considered an eligible student meeting the SAP requirements. If the student fails to meet the terms of their Appeal, their aid will be suspended until the student can re-establish SAP on their own without aid. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Undergraduate students must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Post-Baccalaureate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Graduate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 70 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer credits UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). These pace calculations include all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e. independent study courses). Please Note: Required remedial courses will count toward the Pace requirement. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the Pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). All undergraduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following year limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional years of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study (major) or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Full-time students are allowed up to six years (i.e., 12 semesters) of financial aid eligibility, depending on their class standing when they are admitted. The initial class level is assigned by the Office of Admissions, based on transfer credits accepted, including Advanced Placement units. Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum year limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum year limit. Maximum Time-frame measure also includes all of the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Every term in which the student was enrolled with official part-time status is counted as a quarter-year of eligibility used. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached the maximum year limit. If a student attempts more than 9 units in summer, he will have used one half-year of eligibility. If a student attempts 9 or fewer units in summer, he will have used one quarter-year of eligibility. Accepted transfer units taken between (non-concurrent) enrollment at UC Merced will be added to the total number of transfer units the student has and will be used to determine remaining years of eligibility. Units taken while concurrently enrolled at UC Merced do not count as a separate year of eligibility. Students acquiring a second bachelor’s degree will have up to two years of additional eligibility. Title IV financial aid eligibility (no institutional aid will be awarded), not to exceed eight years (six years of Title IV eligibility for the first bachelor’s and an additional two for the second bachelor’s). Students pursuing a double-major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Post-Baccalaureate (Teacher Preparation Program) Post-baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program students are eligible for financial aid for up to 2.5 years (i.e., 5 semesters) of academic year attendance following completion of their baccalaureate degree (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). All post-baccalaureate financial aid applicants exceeding the following term limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional terms of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. All graduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following term limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional terms of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. are eligible for financial aid for up to three years (i.e., 6 semesters) of academic year attendance following completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum term limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum term limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum term limit. If a student attempts more than 8 units in summer, he will have used one term of eligibility. If a student attempts 8 or fewer units in summer, he will have used a half-term of eligibility. Every term in which the student was enrolled with official part-time status is counted as a half-term of eligibility used. may be eligible for financial aid for up to 7.5 years (i.e., 15 semesters) of academic year attendance following the completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum term limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum term limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum term limit. If a student attempts 9 or more units in summer, he will have used one term of eligibility. If a student attempts 8 or fewer units in summer, he will have used a half-term of eligibility. Every term in which the student was enrolled as official part-time status is counted as a half-term of eligibility used. Students wishing to appeal must submit a UC Merced SAP Appeal to the UC Merced Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. All appeals must state the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances during the term(s) in question that hindered academic performance, such as prolonged hospitalization, death or extreme sickness in the family, etc. Supporting documentation of these extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships once the appeal has been submitted electronically. Furthermore, students must submit, as part of the appeal, information regarding what has changed that would prevent a recurrence and would now allow them to re-establish the satisfactory academic progress requirements by the conclusion of the outlined time-frame. In the appeal, students must detail how they will make up their deficiencies: If deficient in units, what they will do to ensure that they pass the minimum number of units the following academic year to meet the minimum unit or pace requirements by the conclusion of the plan; If deficient in GPA, the minimum GPA required for each future term to eventually meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirement by the conclusion of the plan; If maximum number of terms of eligibility has been reached, the number of additional future terms required to complete degree requirements. Please Note: In all circumstances, students must report which future terms of enrollment will be required to complete any and all academic deficiencies. Academic Advisors will review and suggest academic plans for each appeal submitted. By suggesting a plan, the advisor ensures that, if followed, the plan will permit the student to meet the SAP requirements at the end of the plan’s duration. Deadline dates for each term are published annually on financial aid website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If students notified, do not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a request in writing to the Office Financial Aid and Scholarships for consideration of a late appeal. Once received by the aid office, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Appeals will be considered incomplete until documentation is received. An email is sent to the student with instructions to submit the documentation to the OFAS. Once accepted, appeals will be evaluated by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email letter that the decision is final and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. If the appeal is approved, students will be sent an email notifying them to log into their SAP Appeal to view and accept the terms and conditions of their appeal. Note: if the terms and conditions are not accepted a student’s financial aid will not disburse. Students withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: the date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or the date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who will be on a Planned Education Leave are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of his/her intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. For additional detailed information about Return to Title IV Funds at UC Merced, please see the “Return to Title IV Aid” guide available at the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. IMPORTANT WARNING: Your semesters of financial aid eligibility are limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave you use up one semester of eligibility! Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, Financial Aid proceeds are distributed to the student’s account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. This money will be applied towards institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate.

Science, technology and innovation are the keys to future prosperity and quality of life. The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Following Majors: The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Natural Sciences Education Minor with Teaching Credential Training in science and mathematics is more valuable than ever as the need for affordable and renewable energy, clean and abundant water, safe food, sustainable ecosystems, and improved health care continues to grow. These large-scale challenges can only be solved by diverse teams of scientists working side-by-side with communities, businesses, and scholars from other disciplines. A degree in science can open doors to a multitude of practical and fulfilling careers, all of which can make the world a better place. Faculty in the School of Natural Sciences are committed to providing the next generation of problem-solvers with more than just information. We will teach you to apply scientific reasoning to ask and answer important questions using cutting-edge experimental, computational, and theoretical tools. Many of our graduates go to rewarding jobs upon receiving their diplomas, while others enroll in graduate or professional schools. No matter what path you choose, your life will benefit from being a well-trained scientist and member of our campus community. We welcome you to UC Merced and invite you to visit your faculty members and advisors to talk about the many exciting opportunities for you here in the School of Natural Sciences and beyond. Science is part of the reality of living; it is the what, the how, and the why of everything in our experience. The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and Earth systems science are the links to making discoveries about the natural world, the impact of human activities on that world and the impact of that world on human health. The academic programs in the School of Natural Sciences are designed to help students learn fundamental scientific principles in the context of the real world. Discovery consists in seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what no one else has thought. Answering questions requires creativity and innovation— creativity to think about a problem in a different way; to design the strategy to, for example, discover the gene(s) responsible for asthma, cancer or cardiovascular disease; to generate ideas for new technologies. Students in the School of Natural Sciences receive the foundational learning to create innovative technologies to solve problems and implement solutions. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. Understanding and prediction must precede protection. Students in the School of Natural Sciences fully understand the complex interactions between the physical and biological world and the consequences of society’s actions on the Earth and its biota. With this understanding, they are well positioned to manage and preserve our resources for future generations. Louis Pasteur’s theory of germs is ridiculous fiction. The understanding of science has improved and will continue to improve. Health and disease, prevention and treatment rely on understanding complex systems. Students in Natural Sciences at UC Merced are at the forefront of state-of-the art research and technology to unravel biological complexity. They are the world’s future scientists, healers and policy makers. All School of Natural Sciences students, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for the BS degree. The School of Natural Sciences degree requirements are at least 120, but not more than 150 semester units. All courses required for completion of a major (or minor) in Natural Sciences must be passed with a grade of C- or better. Courses taken towards major requirements may only apply to one requirement. Sharing courses between major requirements is not permitted. Majors in the School of Natural Sciences are competitive and space is limited. Students must make appropriate degree progress to remain in any Natural Sciences major. Students in the Natural Sciences must meet the following requirements to continue in the School: All students must pass the following courses with a C- or better, prior to the start of the third regular (Fall/Spring) semester. If they fail to do this, they are ineligible for continued enrollment in a Natural Sciences major and are moved to undeclared status. MATH 021: Calculus I for Physical Sciences and Engineering Students may repeat a course only one time (for a total of two attempts to earn a C- or better). If students do not complete these requirements, they may take these courses at another institution and petition to be readmitted to the School of Natural Sciences. Students who have been removed from the major for academic reasons must meet the following requirements in order to petition to be re-admitted to the School of Natural Sciences: Cumulative University of California grade point average of at least 2.0 Current semester grade point average of at least 2.0 Completion of all lower division courses with grades of C- or higher Please see the transfer requirements included in the major portion of the catalog. Students who transfer with fewer than 45 transferable semester units will need to complete the Natural Sciences general education and courses required outside of Natural Sciences and Engineering. Partnership with Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks UC Merced has partnership agreements for education and research with Sequoia, Kings Canyon and Yosemite National Parks. In cooperation with schools in the San Joaquin Valley, the partnership has been sponsoring summer environmental education programs for high school students.

It reflects mankind’s indomitable spirit of optimism that we can and must do better. Every human pursuit benefits from the ongoing process of evaluation and discovery. As the tenth campus of the University of California, UC Merced joins in the University’s unparalleled history of research accomplishments. That history also sets the high standards that UC Merced must live up to. As an undergraduate student at UC Merced, you will find faculty research enriching your education and your ability to analyze and critique information objectively. Exposure to research will help you to begin to define solutions to the weighty problems with which humankind will wrestle during your lifetime. Your courses will be continually enriched and invigorated by faculty discoveries, which reflect an ever-evolving curriculum. You will also have formal opportunities to participate in ongoing faculty projects, joining graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in labs, field work and other research settings. These opportunities will extend your classroom experiences and highlight the process of discovery that is critical to each discipline. You will not only learn the knowledge created in the past by others, but you will have the very real opportunity to create new knowledge that other students will learn in the future. As a graduate student you will plumb the depths of some of the world’s most challenging problems through your research and scholarly work. Graduate students work with faculty as apprentice scholars, building the skills needed to create and communicate discoveries in their field. The distinguishing feature of many of UC Merced’s graduate programs is their interdisciplinary nature, which provides a breadth of knowledge that helps put studies into a wider context. You will join a community of scholars and set your course for a career. Part of your research experience will include working closely with your faculty mentor and advisory committee as you build professional expertise and prepare for the future. To foster discovery that brings faculty insights from many disciplines together, UC Merced is structuring many of its research and graduate educational activities around research institutes composed of faculty from multiple schools. For further information about research at UC Merced, see Interdisciplinary Research Institutes And Programs Center for Research in the Humanities and Arts The Center for Research in the Humanities & Arts (CRHA), established in 2008, is designed around interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge. The Center seeks to recreate the Renaissance integration of multiple approaches to knowledge, encompassing the humanities, arts and qualitative social sciences. Theses areas of academic study share a concern with the ways in which human beings conceive, express, and enact their situations in and relations to societies, both local and, increasingly, global. The Center for Research in the Humanities & Arts provides spaces for discussion, conversation, and the extended pursuit of ideas. The shared concerns of various disciplines can be explored in ways that enrich research. By providing a context to challenge the self-validating paradigms of individual disciplines, the Center supports the divergent thinking that is the source of creative scholarship. In addition, we seek to make the significance of the enduring questions addressed by the humanities and arts more visible for both the campus and the community. The Center is part of the University of California Humanities Network, which incorporates the UC Society of Fellows in the Humanities, the University of California Humanities Research Institute, and the UC Consortium of Humanities Centers. The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) creates information technology solutions for many of our most pressing social, environmental, and health care problems. CITRIS was created “to shorten the pipeline” between world-class laboratory research and the creation of start-ups, large companies, and whole industries. CITRIS facilitates partnerships and collaborations among more than 300 faculty members and thousands of students from numerous departments at four University of California campuses (Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz) with industrial researchers from over 60 corporations. Together, the groups are thinking about information technology in ways its never been thought of before. UC Merced’s node of CITRIS engages faculty and students in a number of research efforts that occur at Merced alone as well as with the partner campuses in CITRIS. CITRIS investigators at UC Merced work in the areas of Energy, Democracy, Infrastructure and Health. CITRIS is also the home of UC Merced’s Mobile App Challenge. The mission of the Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI) is to promote all research in the human health sciences at UCM. Research perspectives within the HSRI currently include health psychology, medical anthropology, medical sociology, cognitive science, neuroscience, molecular cell biology, biochemistry, stem cell biology, bioengineering, and computational biology, involving faculty from all three schools. Human health issues are complex, requiring research from multiple perspectives. The HSRI promotes the organization of its member laboratories into synergistic teams, combining complementary disciplinary expertise to effectively tackle complex problems in human health. The formation of these inter- and multidisciplinary research teams is facilitated by (1) securing funds for compelling research initiatives by HSRI subgroups such as through program projects; (2) actively recruiting the best and brightest graduate students and postdocs by showcasing the resources available to them in the health sciences; (3) hosting various means for members to communicate and interact around their research, such as through an annual HSRI symposium, visiting scholar presentations, seminars, and other regularly scheduled activities that bring members together; and (4) maintaining core facilities that will support research in the health sciences. Research facilitated by HSRI sponsored activities will solidify UCM as a leader of human health research, which will allow us to continue to attract top talent at the faculty, postdoctoral, and student levels. The mission of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI) is to discover and disseminate new knowledge that contributes to sustaining natural resources and promoting social well being in the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada regions of California, and related regions worldwide, through integrated research in the natural, social and engineering sciences. The mission of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute is accomplished through: Collaborative, multidisciplinary, fundamental research conducted by faculty, students, staff and affiliated scientists in natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Strong interactions with related research units within the UC system and close collaborative relations with scientists and managers at national laboratories, and local, state and federal agencies, including the National Park Service. Connecting objective, science-based data and information with public and private stakeholders. The Sierra Nevada Research Institute is organized around an Environmental Systems model. A particular emphasis is on the physical and biological connections that exist between the Central Valley and Sierra ecosystems. Through these balanced research efforts, the Sierra Nevada Research Institute serves as a source of objective scientific information for public policy makers as California faces the growing challenge of sustaining the integrity and quality of its resources into the future. Through the Sierra Nevada Research Institute our students and faculty have access to a variety of biological field stations in Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks. In May 2004, Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada Research Institute dedicated the first of these stations, located in Wawona. The Wawona station gives logistical support for academic field research and outreach activities in Yosemite National Park. In addition, the Virginia Smith Trust Reserve adjacent to the UC Merced campus provides additional sites for research. UC Merced faculty currently affiliated with the Sierra Nevada Research Institute are working on climate change and ecosystem health, contaminant transformations in soils and aquatic systems, development of environmental sensors, hydrologic processes in the Sierra Nevada, nutrient transport in agricultural and natural systems, water and air quality in the Valley basin and Sierra Nevada Range, and computational ecology and biodiversity. The goal of the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SpARC) Centralized Research Center is to add value and capabilities to UC Merced’s existing and planned research, teaching, administrative, and community outreach efforts in the area of spatial analysis and spatial science. Many UC Merced faculty are engaged in spatial sciences including historians and archaeologists, social and cognitive scientists, engineers, computer scientists, environmental scientists, and biologists. SpARC’s mission extends across all three academic Schools and has connections with the Sierra Nevada Research Institute, the Great Valley Center, Yosemite National Park, the Center for the Study of Health Disparities, and the Division of Administration. SpARC aims to foster new intellectual collaboration, stimulate new sources of funding, further innovative and original research, supply research techniques and services to faculty groups, perform services and outreach to the public and support student learning. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC) was established in spring 2014, with a mission to encourage and facilitate faculty-mentored undergraduate research projects and creative activities across all academic disciplines. Regardless of major or future career choice, involvement in such activities provide skills in understanding and applying research methods or creative principles and enhance students’ abilities in critical analysis, problem solving, and communication. UROC offers a wide variety of services to prepare students to engage in research, including paid research training and graduate preparation, access to research opportunities/listings through the UROC Research Portal, STEM diversity and leadership seminars, and an annual summer undergraduate research symposium. Our UROC Scholars community of high achieving students provides academic mentorship, leadership and professional training and opportunities for students to travel across the nation and present their research.

UC Merced offers the Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. New students are assigned a faculty advisor and committee that assist them in developing a curriculum to meet the requirements. Although considerable flexibility to meet individual needs exists, requirements usually include a core of required material that a student must master. The M.S. and M.A. degrees are either Plan I or Plan II programs. Plan I requires a minimum of 24 semester units in approved graduate courses plus completion of a thesis. Plan II requires at least 24 semester units in approved graduate courses, followed by a comprehensive examination administered by the faculty. Students pursuing M.S. or M.A. Plan I degrees will begin their thesis research at the end of the first year. Although they may continue to take additional graduate seminars or independent study, the majority of the second year involves thesis research and writing. The thesis committee must approve the scope of the thesis and provide guidance during the process of developing the thesis. Approval of the thesis must be unanimous for the awarding of the master’s degree. The Ph.D. degree is designed to prepare students for creative activity and original research. A doctoral degree is awarded in recognition of a student’s knowledge of a broad field of learning and for distinguished accomplishment in that field through an original contribution of significant knowledge. The dissertation must demonstrate a high level of critical ability, imagination and synthesis. In contrast to the master’s degrees, there are no University unit requirements for the doctorate, although individual programs may set specific course requirements. However, students must complete at least four semesters of academic residence at UC Merced and successfully complete the course requirements before they are allowed to take the Qualifying Examination. All students pursuing the Ph.D. degree must pass a Qualifying Examination before admission to candidacy. The intent of this examination is to ascertain the breadth of a student’s comprehension of fundamental facts and principles that apply in the major field of study. It will also determine the student’s ability to think critically about the theoretical and practical aspects of the field. Students are advanced to candidacy when they fulfill the following requirements: • Successfully completed the Qualifying Exam; • Maintained a minimum grade point average of 3.0; • Received incomplete grades in no more than two courses; and • Fulfilled any language requirement associated with their program. Once a student is advanced to candidacy, it is imperative that he/she begin his/her dissertation studies promptly.

The Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs is a system-wide body that assures coordination between the campuses and develops general policies that govern graduate education throughout the University of California. Several forms of financial support are available to facilitate the pursuit of a graduate education at UC Merced. Most forms of support are granted for merit, while others are granted for financial need or a combination of merit and need. The Graduate Division works closely with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and the academic units to coordinate all forms of financial support. The Graduate Division and Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships administer need-based financial aid for graduate students. We are here to help students understand financial aid opportunities as well as the criteria utilized in determining eligibility for the various financial aid programs available at UC Merced. For more information on graduate student financial support, please see Financial support is available at UC Merced in the form of graduate student research positions, teaching assistantships, fellowships and loans. All students, regardless of income, are encouraged to apply. Graduate Student Research (GSR) Positions Research positions afford excellent opportunities for graduate students to gain invaluable experience in areas of importance to your graduate education while receiving financial support. Information and application materials for GSR positions are available from the academic units. Graduate students working toward advanced degrees are given duties in undergraduate courses that may include conducting discussion or laboratory sections, grading student work and providing students with individual help in the subject. Teaching assistants are chosen for their excellent scholarship and promise as teachers. They serve apprenticeships under active tutelage and supervision of regular faculty members. Teaching assistants engage in learning how to teach and work closely with faculty mentors. A limited number of teaching assistantships are available each year. On the recommendation of the academic deans, the academic units make appointments to teaching assistantships. Fellowships are awarded primarily on the basis of merit and the promise of outstanding academic and professional achievement. Consideration is given to the extent and quality of previous undergraduate and graduate work, evidence of ability in research or other creative accomplishment, evidence of intellectual capacity and promise of productive scholarship. Financial need or the availability of other sources of support in your graduate program is not relevant to the evaluation of academic merit, but may be an additional criterion for some fellowships. Students must establish eligibility for need-based fellowships by filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). For faster and more accurate filing, students can complete the FAFSA online at Financial aid awards that require repayment, loans, offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. Some loan programs are based on financial need, but there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest loans. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans - Not based on financial need, these loans are available to all eligible students, regardless of income. This loan is “unsubsidized” in that the student is responsible for paying all interest due. There is no federal interest subsidy for the loan. Interest accrues immediately upon disbursement. Borrowers may elect to pay accrued interest on a monthly or quarterly basis or have it added back to the principal balance in a process called capitalization. PLUS Loans for Graduate and Professional Degree Students – Graduate and professional degree students are eligible to borrow under the PLUS Loan Program up to their cost of attendance minus other estimated financial assistance. The terms and conditions applicable to Parent PLUS Loans also apply to Graduate/Professional PLUS loans. These requirements include a determination that the applicant does not have an adverse credit history, repayment beginning on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Applicants for these loans are required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). They also must have applied for their annual loan maximum eligibility under the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program before applying for a Graduate/Professional PLUS loan. section under Financial Aid and Scholarships for more information on the academic requirements for student loans. General Requirements for Graduate Degrees Most requirements for graduate degree programs are determined by the Graduate Group that offers the degree. However, the Graduate Council, on behalf of the Academic Senate, has approval authority over all graduate programs on the Merced campus. Graduate students must complete a minimum of 4 units of letter-graded coursework, either upper division or graduate-level, at some point prior to receiving a graduate degree at UC Merced. If admitted for a second graduate degree, student will be held to all the usual degree requirements and University regulations pertaining to fees, examinations for advancement to candidacy, residency, etc. Courses already applied to any previously earned graduate degree cannot be applied toward the requirements of the second degree. In accordance with the policy approved by the Graduate Council, the Graduate Dean has delegated the authority to admit students for a second Master’s degree to the Graduate Groups. While official policy is to discourage duplication of degrees, graduate groups may allow more than one degree at the same level, including more than one academic or professional master’s. Admissions for a second Ph.D. is rarely granted and must be handled as an exception to policy and approved by the Graduate Dean. All requests must be made in writing to the Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Ph.D., as well as a statement assuring the Dean that the applicant’s first Ph.D. is an unrelated area and that there will be no duplication or waiving of coursework. Transfer of credit toward master’s degree requirements are governed by the University regulation and policy summarized in the Graduate Policies and Procedures Handbook. Courses taken toward a graduate degree at another institution cannot be transferred for credit toward a Ph.D. at UCM. However a course requirement may be waived if a similar course was taken at another institution."

Students who receive financial aid may receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans and work-study. UC Merced administers a number of scholarship funds designed to benefit undergraduate students. These scholarships are provided through the generosity of UC alumni, friends of UC Merced, corporations, businesses, professional associations and UC Merced. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit, academic achievement or special talents and do not have to be repaid. Some scholarships are also awarded on the basis of financial need. For new students, one application does it all! All incoming students are automatically considered for all institutional scholarships administered by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships simply by submitting a (undocumented students) by March 2. New students must have at least a 3.25 GPA to be considered for most scholarships. (undocumented students) AND a Continuing Student Scholarship Application by March 2 at . Continuing students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA as of the end of the prior fall semester to be considered for institutional scholarships. Following is a partial list of scholarships that are administered through the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office and awarded to new and continuing students through the application process explained above: Beverlee Sieghold Antoine Endowed Scholarship John C. “Jack” Pjerrou Endowed Scholarship Kris-Tangella Academic Excellence Endowed Scholarship Merced County Association of Realtors Scholarship Merced Mall Regional Shopping Center Scholarship Merced School Employees Federal Credit Union (MSEFCU) Scholarship Stephanie Rae Tomford Endowed Scholarship Wells Fargo Scholarship for High School and Transfer Students Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need and do not have to be repaid. The Federal Government provides funds for Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The State of California also offers Grants (A and B), Middle Class Scholarships (MCS), and Chafee Grant for Current or Former Foster Youth to qualified undergraduate students. In addition, institutional grant funds are provided by the University of California. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, applicants must be U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, be enrolled in an eligible undergraduate program, have not previously received a bachelor’s degree, and demonstrate financial need. The amount you receive depends on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as determined by completing the FAFSA, as well as your enrollment load. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants These are need-based grants provided to low-income undergraduate students to promote access to post-secondary education. Priority is given to students with exceptional financial need. To be eligible for a Cal Grant award, applicants must be California residents or meet the eligibility criteria for AB 540, demonstrate financial need and meet appropriate deadlines. The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) administers the Cal Grant program. Go to the CSAC website at awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant covers UC systemwide tuition and Student Service fees. Note: It does not cover campus-based fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. For first-year students, Cal Grant B provides a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. For students in their second through fourth years, it covers UC systemwide tuition and Student Service fees, plus a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. eligibility is determined by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) and awards are determined by the campus. MCS applies to undergraduate students who do not qualify for the UC Blue & Gold Opportunity Program. Those with family incomes up to $110,001 and household assets of no more than $165,000, MCS will cover up to 40% of UC Systemwide tuition and Student Service Fees. Those with family incomes over $110,001 and up to $165,000 per year and household assets of no more than $165,000, MCS will cover up between 10% - 40% of UC Systemwide tuition and Student Service Fees. Note: Eligibility for MCS will be reduced by the amount of other need-based aid applied to cover UC Systemwide tuition and Student Service Fees (e.g., Pell Grant, Cal Grant, Fee Waivers, institutional need-based aid such as Bobcat Grant, Scholarships, etc.). Awards are typically posted in early August. eligibility is determined by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). This grant provides up to $5,000 a year for current or former foster youth. The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Application is available on the Commission’s Web site at https://www.chafee.csac.ca.gov/default.asp The University of California returns a portion of all tuition revenue to financial aid programs. UC Merced uses this funding to provide a need-based institutional grant program (Bobcat Grants) to eligible students. Eligibility is determined using the UC Education Financing Model (EFM) formula approved by the UC Regents for all UC campuses. Award amounts may be impacted by waivers and/or Cost of Attendance changes when moving from on-campus to off-campus. Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. The State of California requires that students be told the following: Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning that the Department of Education provides the funding for this federal loan program. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school, but can defer any interest payment until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time working towards a degree. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. Students who are awarded a Federal Work-Study (FWS) award are given the opportunity to earn money by working part-time typically on-campus. Similar to a regular job, students are paid twice a month for the hours they work. This money may be used for any educationally related expenses that occur throughout the year. Students may only earn up to the amount they were awarded. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award on-line at: Center for Career and Professional Advancement is available to assist students in finding a Federal Work-Study position. Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the criteria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S.; be accepted for admission to the University; be enrolled and in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted toward half- or full-time enrollment); demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans); maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; be registered for the selective service if the student is a male and 18 to 25 years old, and is not currently on active duty with the armed forces; and not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Please note: Financial need is the difference between the reasonable, approved expenses of attending UC Merced and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full-time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Undergraduate Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid eligibility, students must meet four standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, a minimum cumulative unit requirement and a maximum time-frame requirement. If a student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Students pursuing a double major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements; or the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. A student who has financial aid eligibility reinstated as the result of an appeal is placed on SAP probation and becomes subject to the terms of an academic plan. All work performed to regain eligibility under this SAP policy must be completed at UC Merced. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) will evaluate whether the student is adhering to the plan on a term-by-term basis. If the student has made up all deficiencies, he or she will no longer be considered on probation and instead will be considered an eligible student meeting the SAP requirements. Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. Requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCM Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. These requirements are separate and distinct from UC Merced’s policy regarding satisfactory academic progress set by The Office of the Registrar. Note: Some funds have higher academic and/or enrollment requirements. An undergraduate student will be ineligible for aid unless an appeal is approved if one of the following occurs: • The student’s cumulative University of California grade point average is less than 2.0. All undergraduates must complete at least 70 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer credits UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). These pace calculations include all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e. independent study courses). Required remedial courses will count toward the undergraduate pace requirement. 1 year attended - 1 full time term/1 part time term Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the unit requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). Transfer courses and required remedial courses will count toward the undergraduate student unit requirement. Only the transfer units earned during the academic year for which the Financial Aid SAP processing is being run will count. All undergraduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following year limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional years of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study (major) or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Students are allowed up to six years of financial aid eligibility, depending on their class standing when they are admitted. The initial class level is assigned by the Office of Admissions, based on transfer credits accepted, including Advanced Placement units. Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum year limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum year limit. Maximum Time-frame measure also includes all of the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Every term in which the student was enrolled with official part-time status is counted as a quarter-year of eligibility used. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached the maximum year limit. If a student attempts more than 9 units in summer, he will have used one half-year of eligibility. If a student attempts 9 or fewer units in summer, he will have used one quarter-year of eligibility. Accepted transfer units taken between (non-concurrent) enrollment at UC Merced will be added to the total number of transfer units the student has and will be used to determine remaining years of eligibility. Units taken while concurrently enrolled at UC Merced do not count as a separate year of eligibility. Students acquiring a second bachelor’s degree will have up to two years of additional eligibility. Title IV financial aid eligibility (no institutional aid will be awarded), not to exceed eight years (six years of Title IV eligibility for the first bachelor’s and an additional two for the second bachelor’s). Appeal Process for Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress If a student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements; or if the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. Undergraduate students wishing to appeal must submit a UC Merced SAP Appeal to the UC Merced Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. All appeals must state the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances during the term(s) in question that hindered academic performance, such as prolonged hospitalization, death or extreme sickness in the family, etc. Supporting documentation of these extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarship once the appeal has been submitted electronically. Furthermore, students must submit, as part of the appeal, information regarding what has changed that would prevent a recurrence and would now allow them to reestablish the satisfactory academic requirements by the conclusion of the outlined time frame. As part of the appeal, students must propose how they will make up their deficiencies: If deficient in units, what they will do to ensure they pass the minimum number of units the following academic year to meet the minimum unit or pace requirements by the conclusion of the plan; If deficient in GPA, the minimum GPA required for each future term to eventually meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirement by the conclusion of the plan; If maximum number of terms of eligibility has been reached, the number of additional future terms required to complete degree requirements. In all circumstances, students must report which future terms of enrollment will be required to complete any and all academic deficiencies. Academic advisers will review and suggest academic plans for each appeal submitted. By suggesting a plan, an adviser ensures that, if followed, the plan will permit the student to meet the SAP requirements at the end of the plan’s duration. Deadline dates for each term are published annually on the financial aid website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If students notified do not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a request in writing to the Office Financial Aid and Scholarships for consideration of a late appeal. Once received by the aid office, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Applications will be considered incomplete until satisfactory documentation is received. An email is sent to the student with instructions to submit the documentation to the OFAS. Once accepted, appeals will be evaluated by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email letter that the decision is final and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. If the appeal is approved, students will be sent an email notifying them to log into their SAP Appeal to view and accept the terms and conditions of their appeal. Note: if the terms and conditions are not accepted a student’s financial aid will not disburse. Graduate Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid eligibility, students must meet four standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, a minimum cumulative unit requirement and a maximum time-frame requirement. If a student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements; or if the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. A student who has his or her financial aid eligibility reinstated is placed on probation and becomes subject to the terms of an academic plan. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) will evaluate whether the student is adhering to the plan on a term-by-term basis. If the student has made up all of his or her deficiencies, he or she will no longer be considered on probation and instead will be considered an eligible student meeting the SAP requirements. Requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of all Federal Title IV financial aid apply to all applicants. These requirements are separate and distinct from UCM’s policy regarding satisfactory academic progress set by the Graduate Division or the Schools. Note: Some funds have higher academic and/or enrollment requirements. Graduate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA at the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All graduates must complete enough at least 66.6 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. All transfer credits UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e. independent study courses). Required remedial courses will count toward the graduate pace requirement. Graduate financial aid applicants must comply with the following minimum unit requirements by the end of each academic year: 1 year attended - 1 full-time term/1 part-time term Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the minimum cumulative unit/clock hour requirement for graduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). Required remedial courses will count toward the graduate student unit/clock hour requirement. All graduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following term limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional terms of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. MASTER’S DEGREE STUDENTS are eligible for financial aid for up to three years of academic year attendance following completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum term limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum term limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum term limit. If a student attempts more than 8 units in summer, he will have used one term of eligibility.

The recommended decision will be communicated to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships for final approval. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email letter that the decision is final and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. If the appeal is approved, students will be sent an email notifying them to log into their SAP Appeal to view and accept the terms and conditions of their appeal. Note: if the terms and conditions are not accepted a student’s financial aid will not disburse. An undergraduate student withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: 1) the date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or 2) the date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or 3) UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who will be on a Planned Education Leave are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of his/her intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. For additional detailed information about Return to Title IV Funds at UC Merced, please see the “Return to Title IV Aid” guide available at the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. IMPORTANT WARNING: Your semesters of financial aid eligibility are limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave you use up one semester of eligibility! Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, Financial Aid proceeds are distributed to the student’s account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. This money will be applied towards institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate.

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Welcome to the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, at the University of California, Merced! Here, we explore the current and historical dimensions of human existence, from the concepts of citizenship and community, to artistic and literary expression, diverse global and local institutions and cultures, the acquisition and the functions of language, the nature of the mind, the principles of economics and management, and the improvement of public health. This means that the fields of study in SSHA help us to understand the world and our place in it. They also teach us to write convincingly about our ideas and to engage in respectful, thoughtful dialogue with those who might disagree with those ideas. In so doing, they offer us the tools that are essential for promoting, maintaining, and improving our society. Students in SSHA may choose from a broad selection of majors and minors, most of them with a strong interdisciplinary bent that reflects our recognition that, while disciplines provide unique research methodologies for analysis, the systems of knowledge that they represent are always interrelated. The sheer joy of discovering these connections will inspire you to seek more and help you to become a lifelong learner. Citizenship skills and a passion for learning are important, to be sure, but where can you find a job with a degree outside of the STEM fields? The answer is: “almost anywhere.” Just think: the application of technology has uniquely human dimensions; businesses need to understand and communicate linguistically and visually with clients, who often come from a variety of ethnic, racial or gender groups and/or speak different languages; business, policy and public health strategies also benefit from an awareness of historical trends and political institutions; industry spokespeople might just be former drama majors; and so forth. We look forward to exploring the human dimensions of the world with you and engaging you in our many research opportunities. Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, foreign languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. At Least 120 units to include the following: At least 60 semester units of upper division courses. Students must complete all course prerequisites with a C- or better. When a letter grade option is available for a major requirement, students must complete that requirement with a C‐ or better; a 2.0 GPA must be maintained in all major course work. Students must complete all major requirements with a C- or better and maintain a 2.0 GPA in all major course work. Courses graded with a pass/no pass grading option are limited to one third of the total number of units required for general education. Students must obtain pre-approval through the SSHA Advising Office for all courses completed at institutions other than UC Merced. All courses completed at institutions other than UC Merced must be worth at least 3 semester units to fulfill major, minor or general education requirements at UC Merced. ” section on the UC Merced General Education page. Transfer students are strongly encouraged to complete IGETC in order to prepare for work within the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts.

Students applying for admission must meet the examination requirement by taking one of the following examinations by December of the 12th grade. SAT Reasoning Test (taken prior to March 2016) or SAT with Essay (taken March 2016 or later) SAT Subject Tests are optional. Students can demonstrate their knowledge and mastery of specific subjects by taking the tests by December of the 12th grade. The University will use the highest test scores you earn in computing your eligibility for admission, and there is no penalty for taking the examinations more than once. The UC strongly recommends that you submit scores from all tests taken. For more information about taking the tests to fulfill the examination requirement, visit , talk to your school counselor or contact the appropriate testing organization. HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR GRADE-POINT AVERAGE The grade-point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before 12th grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four-point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before 12th grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during 12th grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level courses. Honors courses are Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and designated Standard Level courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school’s course list. Courses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade. No more than two units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 can be assigned extra points. D grades are not assigned extra points. Students who receive D or F grades in “a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or a more advanced level in the same subject. Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International Freshman Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international freshman applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade-point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 6.5. For more information visit Qualifying for Admission Review by Examination Alone You might be able to qualify for admission to the University by examination alone through achieving high scores on the ACT Plus Writing, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essary and two SAT Subject Tests (excluding Mathematics Level 1). To be considered for admission to the University by examination alone, you must achieve a minimum UC Score Total of 410 (425 for nonresidents). In addition, you must earn a minimum UC Score of 63 on each component of the ACT, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay and on each SAT Subject Test. You cannot use a SAT Subject Test to meet these requirements if you have completed a transferable college course in that subject with a grade of C or better. For more information, visit universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/freshman/requirements/examination/ All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors can be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as freshmen: Academic GPA in all required “a-g” courses, including additional points for completion of University-certified honors courses. Scores on the ACT Plus Writing or SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay, and any scores earned in SAT Subject Tests. SAT Subject Tests are not required but can be considered if submitted. Number, content of and performance in academic courses beyond the minimum “a-g” requirements. Number of and performance in University-approved honors courses, and Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and transferable college courses. Identification as being ranked in the top 9 percent of your high school class at the end of your junior year (“eligible in the local context”). Quality of your senior-year program, as measured by the type and number of academic courses in progress or planned. Quality of your academic performance relative to the educational opportunities available in your secondary school. Outstanding performance in one or more academic subject areas. Outstanding work in one or more special projects in any academic field of study. Recent, marked improvement in academic performance, as demonstrated by your academic GPA and the quality of coursework completed or in progress. Special talents, achievements and awards in a particular field, such as visual and performing arts, communication or athletic endeavors; special skills, such as demonstrated written and oral proficiency in other languages; special interests, such as intensive study and exploration of other cultures; experiences that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, such as significant community service or significant participation in student government; or other significant experiences or achievements that demonstrate your promise for contributing to the intellectual vitality of the campus. Completion of special projects undertaken either in the context of your high school curriculum or in conjunction with special school events, projects or programs. Academic accomplishments in light of your life experiences and special circumstances. If you enrolled in a regular session of college- or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a freshman. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges who have completed at least 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units). While preparing to transfer at the junior level, you must complete a pattern of courses that will prepare you for further study in your chosen major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available at admissions.ucmerced.edu/major-preparation If you are enrolled at a California Community College, you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower-division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman- and sophomore-level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition, you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the Transfer Credit Practices Section of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found at Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter-grade basis will be computed into the grade-point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your GPA. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. If you have attended only community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit, and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university can have up to 79 transferable semester (118 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer without a dean’s review. Applicants with 80 semester (120 quarter) units or more; a dean’s review is required. Transfer Credit Policy for University of California, Merced, Effective Fall 2014 The University of California, Merced, grants unit credit for college courses completed at United States regionally accredited colleges and universities; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Courses determined to be essentially the same as courses offered for an undergraduate degree at any UC campus will be granted credit, if the course: Is listed in the original institution’s catalog/website of official courses offered for the year in which the course was completed, and Includes the same or similar content, and Requires the same or similar prerequisite course work, and Is offered at the same level of instruction. Courses that further the student’s knowledge and understanding in fundamental liberal arts disciplines such as mathematics, natural science, literature, social sciences, fine arts and philosophy are acceptable for transfer if comparable in scope and depth to those offered at the UC. Courses accepted for transfer must be reported on an official transcript (academic record), which must be provided to UC Merced in a sealed envelope from the original college/university of enrollment, bearing the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. UC Merced can award lower-division (freshman/sophomore level) units for military courses completed if the courses are consistent with the University policy on granting transfer credit when there is an equivalent course taught at a UC campus. UC Merced will consult the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations for information regarding course content as a guide to the awarding of credit. work experience, military/recruit basic training, vocational or technical training, or remedial academic or personal enrichment courses. Remedial academic courses in English and mathematics are not transferable. Courses completed at unaccredited/nonregionally accredited institution could be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Courses from enrollment at another UC main campus (not UC Extension) during a regular academic (fall, winter or spring) or summer term are all transferable. Courses from enrollment at any UC Extension are transferable if the course is numbered 1-199; courses numbered 1-99 that include a campus designation (e.g. XB, XSB) are equivalent to the same course offered to undergraduates on that campus. UC Merced grants credit for examinations as follows: International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level GCE or Hong Kong Advanced Level (A-Levels) – unit credit could be granted for satisfactory grades and scores. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST) exams. Students will be granted up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any other institution or any combination of other institutions. For units beyond the maximum allowed, subject credit for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation will be granted and can be used to satisfy requirements. Units earned through AP, IB and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. Units earned at any UC campus (Extension, summer, cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. In addition, there is a limit to the number of units for which UC Merced grants credit in the following areas: English as a Second Language courses: Maximum 8 semester/12 quarter units Physical Education activity courses: Maximum 4 semester/6 quarter units UC Merced will not grant credit for college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously completed course, or examination for which credit has already been granted, with the exception of the repeat of deficient (D/F) course grades. Every California Community College has an agreement with the UC – a Transfer Course Agreement (TCA). The TCA specifies which courses receive UC credit. To learn if college courses from a California Community College are transferable to UC Merced, visit . These lists are updated throughout the year, so check ASSIST periodically to ensure you have the most current information. Other two-year and four-year Institutions: The UC does not have transfer course agreements with institutions other than the California Community Colleges. However, using ASSIST and/or referring to any UC campus’ general catalog can provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer to UC Merced. UC Merced does not grant credit for junior/community college programs that are technical or vocational, or programs that do not lead to further academic study at a university in the international country. Elementary/intermediate language courses: No credit is granted to students who were instructed in that language during secondary school. Final determination on the transferability of coursework for credit will be made by UC Merced’s Office of Admissions, based on UC Merced’s review (not that of another institution).

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts I would like to welcome you to the UC Merced School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA). Our School is home to many diverse disciplines, programs, students, and faculty. We offer important courses that are the background to a liberal arts education, as well as a range of basic and advanced courses in specific disciplines. Our campus opened-up in 2005, and in a relatively short time, SSHA has grown to be the largest School on campus. Across our 10 departments, we have 14 majors, 18 minors, and 7 graduate programs. SSHA provides opportunities for students to explore subjects in depth, while embracing interdisciplinary study and research. Indeed, UCM has grown faster than any other UC campus, and has achieved or exceeded the timing of many of the milestones expected for a new university. I encourage you to become a SSHA student and be part of this exciting adventure. I am a firm believer in a solid liberal arts education, no matter what your career trajectory. Having exposure to humanities, arts, and social science, will allow you to think critically and creatively. In addition, SSHA faculty have a long tradition of student-focused teaching and research opportunities. Thus, while we are a UC campus, our smaller size and philosophy towards students provides for student-faculty engagement, student research opportunities, and community connections beyond what you may find in other places. Please explore the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts through our . Let us know if you would like to visit or receive more information about our School. Interim Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Carlston Cunningham Chair in Cognitive Development Director, UC Merced Alliance for Child and Family Health and Development Chair, Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, world languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. At Least 120 units to include the following: At least 60 semester units of upper division courses. Students must complete all course prerequisites with a C- or better. When a letter grade option is available for a major requirement, students must complete that requirement with a C‐ or better; a 2.0 GPA must be maintained in all major course work.

The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Following Majors: The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Natural Sciences Education Minor with Teaching Credential Training in science and mathematics is more valuable than ever as the need for affordable and renewable energy, clean and abundant water, safe food, sustainable ecosystems, and improved health care continues to grow. These large-scale challenges can only be solved by diverse teams of scientists working side-by-side with communities, businesses, and scholars from other disciplines. A degree in science can open doors to a multitude of practical and fulfilling careers, all of which can make the world a better place. Faculty in the School of Natural Sciences are committed to providing the next generation of problem-solvers with more than just information. We will teach you to apply scientific reasoning to ask and answer important questions using cutting-edge experimental, computational, and theoretical tools. Many of our graduates go to rewarding jobs upon receiving their diplomas, while others enroll in graduate or professional schools. No matter what path you choose, your life will benefit from being a well-trained scientist and member of our campus community. We welcome you to UC Merced and invite you to visit your faculty members and advisors to talk about the many exciting opportunities for you here in the School of Natural Sciences and beyond. Science is part of the reality of living; it is the what, the how, and the why of everything in our experience. The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and environmental systems science are the links to making discoveries about the natural world, the impact of human activities on that world and the impact of that world on human health. The academic programs in the School of Natural Sciences are designed to help students learn fundamental scientific principles in the context of the real world. Discovery consists in seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what no one else has thought. Answering questions requires creativity and innovation— creativity to think about a problem in a different way; to design the strategy to, for example, discover the gene(s) responsible for asthma, cancer or cardiovascular disease; to generate ideas for new technologies. Students in the School of Natural Sciences receive the foundational learning to create innovative technologies to solve problems and implement solutions. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. Understanding and prediction must precede protection. Students in the School of Natural Sciences fully understand the complex interactions between the physical and biological world and the consequences of society’s actions on the Earth and its biota. With this understanding, they are well positioned to manage and preserve our resources for future generations. Louis Pasteur’s theory of germs is ridiculous fiction. The understanding of science has improved and will continue to improve. Health and disease, prevention and treatment rely on understanding complex systems. Students in Natural Sciences at UC Merced are at the forefront of state-of-the art research and technology to unravel biological complexity. They are the world’s future scientists, healers and policy makers. All School of Natural Sciences students, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for the BS degree. The School of Natural Sciences degree requirements are at least 120, but not more than 150 semester units. All courses required for completion of a major (or minor) in Natural Sciences must be passed with a grade of C- or better. Courses taken towards major requirements may only apply to one requirement. Sharing courses between major requirements is not permitted. Majors in the School of Natural Sciences are competitive and space is limited. Students must make appropriate degree progress to remain in any Natural Sciences major. Students in the Natural Sciences must meet the following requirements to continue in the School: All students must pass the following courses with a C- or better, prior to the start of the third regular (Fall/Spring) semester. If they fail to do this, they are ineligible for continued enrollment in a Natural Sciences major and are moved to undeclared status. MATH 021: Calculus I for Physical Sciences and Engineering Students may repeat a course only one time (for a total of two attempts to earn a C- or better). If students do not complete these requirements, they may take these courses at another institution and petition to be readmitted to the School of Natural Sciences. Students who have been removed from the major for academic reasons must meet the following requirements in order to petition to be re-admitted to the School of Natural Sciences: Cumulative University of California grade point average of at least 2.0 Current semester grade point average of at least 2.0 Completion of all lower division courses with grades of C- or higher Please see the transfer requirements included in the major portion of the catalog. Students who transfer with fewer than 45 transferable semester units will need to complete the Natural Sciences general education and courses required outside of Natural Sciences and Engineering. Partnership with Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks UC Merced has partnership agreements for education and research with Sequoia, Kings Canyon and Yosemite National Parks. In cooperation with schools in the San Joaquin Valley, the partnership has been sponsoring summer environmental education programs for high school students. With the dedication of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute Yosemite Field Station, the partnership has kicked off a new phase of research collaboration that is advancing scientific and cultural understanding, meeting regional needs and enriching university and public education. Research buildings are also available in Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks."

For more information about taking the tests to fulfill the examination requirement, visit , talk to your school counselor or contact the appropriate testing organization. HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR GRADE-POINT AVERAGE The grade-point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before 12th grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four-point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before 12th grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during 12th grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level courses. Honors courses are Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and designated Standard Level courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school’s course list. Courses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade. No more than two units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 can be assigned extra points. D grades are not assigned extra points. Students who receive D or F grades in “a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or a more advanced level in the same subject. Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International Freshman Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international freshman applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade-point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 6.5. For more information visit Qualifying for Admission Review by Examination Alone You might be able to qualify for admission to the University by examination alone through achieving high scores on the ACT Plus Writing, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essary and two SAT Subject Tests (excluding Mathematics Level 1). To be considered for admission to the University by examination alone, you must achieve a minimum UC Score Total of 410 (425 for nonresidents). In addition, you must earn a minimum UC Score of 63 on each component of the ACT, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay and on each SAT Subject Test. You cannot use a SAT Subject Test to meet these requirements if you have completed a transferable college course in that subject with a grade of C or better. For more information, visit universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/freshman/requirements/examination/ All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors can be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as freshmen: Academic GPA in all required “a-g” courses, including additional points for completion of University-certified honors courses. Scores on the ACT Plus Writing or SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay, and any scores earned in SAT Subject Tests. SAT Subject Tests are not required but can be considered if submitted. Number, content of and performance in academic courses beyond the minimum “a-g” requirements. Number of and performance in University-approved honors courses, and Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and transferable college courses. Identification as being ranked in the top 9 percent of your high school class at the end of your junior year (“eligible in the local context”). Quality of your senior-year program, as measured by the type and number of academic courses in progress or planned. Quality of your academic performance relative to the educational opportunities available in your secondary school. Outstanding performance in one or more academic subject areas. Outstanding work in one or more special projects in any academic field of study. Recent, marked improvement in academic performance, as demonstrated by your academic GPA and the quality of coursework completed or in progress.

Academic accomplishments in light of your life experiences and special circumstances. If you enrolled in a regular session of college- or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a freshman. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges who have completed at least 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units). While preparing to transfer at the junior level, you must complete a pattern of courses that will prepare you for further study in your chosen major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available at https://admissions.ucmerced.edu/transfer/major-preparation-schools If you are enrolled at a California Community College, you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower-division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman- and sophomore-level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition, you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the Transfer Credit Practices Section of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found at Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter-grade basis will be computed into the grade-point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your GPA. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. If you have attended only community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit, and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university can have up to 79 transferable semester (118 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer without a dean’s review. Applicants with 80 semester (120 quarter) units or more; a dean’s review is required. Transfer Credit Policy for University of California, Merced, Effective Fall 2014 The University of California, Merced, grants unit credit for college courses completed at United States regionally accredited colleges and universities; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree.

Peterson Endowed Scholarship * Wells Fargo Scholarship for High School and Transfer Students Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment with interest. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. The State of California requires that students be told the following: Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning that the Department of Education provides the funding for this federal loan program. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school, but can defer any interest payment until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time working towards a degree. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. If the parent-borrower does not qualify for a PLUS Loan, they may either: Obtain an Endorser (i.e., another adult who is willing to co-sign the loan); or If the parent cannot locate an Endorser, the dependent student may then qualify to borrow additional Unsubsidized loan funds on their own. Undocumented students who graduate from a California high school and meet the CA Dream Act requirements are eligible for state and university aid; however, they are ineligible for federal aid including federal loans. The DREAM loan program aims to close that gap and provide eligible students with the opportunity to borrow student loans to help pay for their education. There is no interest or payments while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Alternative loans are funds available to students who are not eligible for financial aid or they need additional funds to meet their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance minus other financial aid or the annual loan maximum amount as determined by the lender. Because Alternative Loans are not guaranteed by the federal government, they must be insured privately. This extra cost is passed on to the borrower in the form of higher fees and interest rates. In addition, the lender will look at your credit history as well as other factors to determine if they will lend to you. You may be denied by one lender and approved by another because of the different ways the lender interprets your information. [How to apply] Please Note: Students should exhaust all federal student loan eligibility before borrowing private student loans. Students who are awarded a Federal Work-Study (FWS) award are given the opportunity to earn money by working part-time (i.e., up to 18 hours per week during an academic term) typically on-campus. Students are paid twice a month for the hours they work. This money may be used for any educationally related expenses that occur throughout the year. Students may only earn up to the amount they were awarded. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award on-line at: All FWS and non-FWS jobs are posted by Center for Career & Professional Advancement (CCPA) Office at Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the criteria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S.; be accepted for admission to the University; be enrolled at least half-time and in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted for financial aid purposes, with the exception of the Teacher Preparation Program); demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans); maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; be registered for the selective service if the student is a male and 18 to 25 years old, and is not currently on active duty with the armed forces; and not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Please note: Financial need is the difference between the Cost of Attendance (based on living on-campus, off-campus, or at home) and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Please note, if you are a Cal Grant recipient, in order to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. The Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards listed below apply to all aid applicants, whether aid was received for prior coursework. A student’s eligibility for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is affected by this policy. : In addition to the requirements listed below, all students, whether receiving aid or not, must also meet the university’s academic GPA standards established by the Registrar. Please refer to the Registrar’s website for these standards. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for financial aid eligibility, students must meet all three standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, and a maximum time-frame requirement. If a student fails to maintain SAP, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the SAP requirements; or if the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. A student who has financial aid eligibility reinstated as the result of an appeal is placed on an approved SAP Appeal and becomes subject to the terms of that Appeal. All work performed to regain eligibility under this SAP policy must be completed at UC Merced. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) will evaluate whether the student is adhering to the plan on a term-by-term basis. If the student has made up all deficiencies, he or she will no longer be considered on Appeal and instead will be considered an eligible student meeting the SAP requirements. If the student fails to meet the terms of their Appeal, their aid will be suspended until the student can re-establish SAP on their own without aid. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Undergraduate students must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Post-Baccalaureate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Graduate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 70 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer credits UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). These pace calculations include all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e. independent study courses). Please Note: Required remedial courses will count toward the Pace requirement. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the Pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). All undergraduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following unit limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study (major) or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Full-time students are allowed up to 180 units of financial aid eligibility, including transfer units. 180 units - Transfer Units = Remaining Eligibility for Bachelor Degree Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum unit limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum unit limit. Maximum Time-frame measure also includes all of the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Every unit attempted as of the end of the Add/Drop period is counted toward the maximum time limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached the maximum unit limit. Accepted transfer units taken between (non-concurrent) enrollment at UC Merced will be added to the total number of transfer units the student has and will be used to determine remaining units of eligibility. Units taken while concurrently enrolled at UC Merced do not count as a separate year of eligibility. Students pursuing a double-major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Post-Baccalaureate (Teacher Preparation Program) Post-baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program students are eligible for financial aid for up to 62 units following completion of their baccalaureate degree (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). All post-baccalaureate financial aid applicants exceeding this unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. All graduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. are eligible for financial aid for up to 72 units following completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum unit limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum unit limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum unit limit. may be eligible for financial aid for up to 216 units following the completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum unit limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum unit limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum unit limit. Students wishing to appeal must submit a UC Merced SAP Appeal to the UC Merced Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. All appeals must state the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances during the term(s) in question that hindered academic performance, such as prolonged hospitalization, death or extreme sickness in the family, etc. Supporting documentation of these extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships once the appeal has been submitted electronically. Furthermore, students must submit, as part of the appeal, information regarding what has changed that would prevent a recurrence and would now allow them to re-establish the satisfactory academic progress requirements by the conclusion of the outlined time-frame. In the appeal, students must detail how they will make up their deficiencies: If deficient in units, what they will do to ensure that they pass the minimum number of units the following academic year to meet the minimum unit or pace requirements by the conclusion of the plan; If deficient in GPA, the minimum GPA required for each future term to eventually meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirement by the conclusion of the plan; If maximum units of eligibility has been reached, the number of additional units required to complete degree requirements. Please Note: In all circumstances, students must report which future terms of enrollment will be required to complete any and all academic deficiencies. Academic Advisors will review and suggest academic plans for each appeal submitted. By suggesting a plan, the advisor ensures that, if followed, the plan will permit the student to meet the SAP requirements at the end of the plan’s duration. Deadline dates for each term are published annually on financial aid website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If students notified, do not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a request in writing to the Office Financial Aid and Scholarships for consideration of a late appeal. Once received by the aid office, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Appeals will be considered incomplete until documentation is received. An email is sent to the student with instructions to submit the documentation to the OFAS. Once accepted, appeals will be evaluated by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email letter that the decision is final and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. If the appeal is approved, students will be sent an email notifying them to log into their SAP Appeal to view and accept the terms and conditions of their appeal. Note: if the terms and conditions are not accepted a student’s financial aid will not disburse. Students withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: the date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or the date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who will be on a Planned Education Leave are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of his/her intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. For additional detailed information about Return to Title IV Funds at UC Merced, please see the “Return to Title IV Aid” guide available at the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. IMPORTANT WARNING: Your semesters of financial aid eligibility are limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave you use up one semester of eligibility! Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, Financial Aid proceeds are distributed to the student’s account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. This money will be applied towards institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate.

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts I would like to welcome you to the UC Merced School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA). Our School is home to many diverse disciplines, programs, students, and faculty. We offer important courses that are the background to a liberal arts education, as well as a range of basic and advanced courses in specific disciplines. Our campus opened-up in 2005, and in a relatively short time, SSHA has grown to be the largest School on campus. Across our 10 departments, we have 14 majors, 18 minors, and 7 graduate programs. SSHA provides opportunities for students to explore subjects in depth, while embracing interdisciplinary study and research. Indeed, UCM has grown faster than any other UC campus, and has achieved or exceeded the timing of many of the milestones expected for a new university. I encourage you to become a SSHA student and be part of this exciting adventure. I am a firm believer in a solid liberal arts education, no matter what your career trajectory. Having exposure to humanities, arts, and social science, will allow you to think critically and creatively. In addition, SSHA faculty have a long tradition of student-focused teaching and research opportunities. Thus, while we are a UC campus, our smaller size and philosophy towards students provides for student-faculty engagement, student research opportunities, and community connections beyond what you may find in other places. Please explore the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts through our . Let us know if you would like to visit or receive more information about our School. Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Carlston Cunningham Chair in Cognitive Development Director, UC Merced Alliance for Child and Family Health and Development Chair, Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, world languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. At Least 120 units to include the following: At least 60 semester units of upper division courses. Students must complete all course prerequisites with a C- or better. When a letter grade option is available for a major requirement, students must complete that requirement with a C‐ or better; a 2.0 GPA must be maintained in all major course work. Students must complete all major requirements with a C- or better and maintain a 2.0 GPA in all major course work. Courses graded with a pass/no pass grading option are limited to one third of the total number of units required for general education. Students must obtain pre-approval through the SSHA Advising Office for all courses completed at institutions other than UC Merced. ” section on the UC Merced General Education page. Transfer students are strongly encouraged to complete IGETC in order to prepare for work within the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts. Students who do not complete IGETC before transferring are required to complete SSHA Foundations, an IGETC-like general education pattern. Please see the approved Transfer Selection Criteria under each major in the UC Merced General Catalog for required coursework, and review the Transfer Admission Requirements at the following website: admissions.ucmerced.edu/transfer/requirements To ensure proper placement in our world languages courses, students with previous academic instruction in the language that they would like to study are encouraged to take the placement exam for that language. However, students wishing to use language proficiency to satisfy a major, minor or general education requirement must have their placement scores confirmed by the world languages program. Please contact the World Languages Program Coordinator or a UC Merced academic advisor for more information. Note: Students may not complete placement exams after they have enrolled in a UC Merced course in that language. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Programs The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts is pleased to offer a number of interdisciplinary programs outside of the majors.

https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/content.php?catoid=16&navoid=1528,Research at UC Merced - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™,"Research at UC Merced - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™ School of Social Sciences, Humanities & Arts Ernest and Julio Gallo Management Program Office of Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Physical Operations, Planning and Development School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Research is the pioneering work of the intellect, an adventure at the frontiers of knowledge in which faculty engage both their undergraduate and graduate students. It reflects mankind’s indomitable spirit of optimism that we can and must do better. Every human pursuit benefits from the ongoing process of evaluation and discovery. As the tenth campus of the University of California, UC Merced joins in the University’s unparalleled history of research accomplishments. That history also sets the high standards that UC Merced must live up to. As an undergraduate student at UC Merced, you will find faculty research enriching your education and your ability to analyze and critique information objectively. Exposure to research will help you to begin to define solutions to the weighty problems with which humankind will wrestle during your lifetime. Your courses will be continually enriched and invigorated by faculty discoveries, which reflect an ever-evolving curriculum. You will also have formal opportunities to participate in ongoing faculty projects, joining graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in labs, field work and other research settings. These opportunities will extend your classroom experiences and highlight the process of discovery that is critical to each discipline. You will not only learn the knowledge created in the past by others, but you will have the very real opportunity to create new knowledge that other students will learn in the future. As a graduate student you will plumb the depths of some of the world’s most challenging problems through your research and scholarly work. Graduate students work with faculty as apprentice scholars, building the skills needed to create and communicate discoveries in their field. The distinguishing feature of many of UC Merced’s graduate programs is their interdisciplinary nature, which provides a breadth of knowledge that helps put studies into a wider context. You will join a community of scholars and set your course for a career. Part of your research experience will include working closely with your faculty mentor and advisory committee as you build professional expertise and prepare for the future. To foster discovery that brings faculty insights from many disciplines together, UC Merced is structuring many of its research and graduate educational activities around research institutes composed of faculty from multiple schools. For further information about research at UC Merced, see Interdisciplinary Research Institutes And Programs The Center for Humanities, established in 2008, is designed around interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge. The Center seeks to recreate the Renaissance integration of multiple approaches to knowledge, encompassing the humanities, arts and qualitative social sciences. Theses areas of academic study share a concern with the ways in which human beings conceive, express, and enact their situations in and relations to societies, both local and, increasingly, global. The Center for Humanities provides spaces for discussion, conversation, and the extended pursuit of ideas. The shared concerns of various disciplines can be explored in ways that enrich research. By providing a context to challenge the self-validating paradigms of individual disciplines, the Center supports the divergent thinking that is the source of creative scholarship. In addition, we seek to make the significance of the enduring questions addressed by the humanities and arts more visible for both the campus and the community. The Center is part of the University of California Humanities Network, which incorporates the UC Society of Fellows in the Humanities, the University of California Humanities Research Institute, and the UC Consortium of Humanities Centers. The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) creates information technology solutions for many of our most pressing social, environmental, and health care problems. CITRIS was created “to shorten the pipeline” between world-class laboratory research and the creation of start-ups, large companies, and whole industries. CITRIS facilitates partnerships and collaborations among more than 300 faculty members and thousands of students from numerous departments at four University of California campuses (Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz) with industrial researchers from over 60 corporations. Together, the groups are thinking about information technology in ways its never been thought of before. UC Merced’s node of CITRIS engages faculty and students in a number of research efforts that occur at Merced alone as well as with the partner campuses in CITRIS. CITRIS investigators at UC Merced work in the areas of Energy, Democracy, Infrastructure and Health. CITRIS is also the home of UC Merced’s Mobile App Challenge. The mission of the Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI) is to promote all research in the human health sciences at UCM. Research perspectives within the HSRI currently include health psychology, medical anthropology, medical sociology, cognitive science, neuroscience, molecular cell biology, biochemistry, stem cell biology, bioengineering, and computational biology, involving faculty from all three schools. Human health issues are complex, requiring research from multiple perspectives. The HSRI promotes the organization of its member laboratories into synergistic teams, combining complementary disciplinary expertise to effectively tackle complex problems in human health. The formation of these inter- and multidisciplinary research teams is facilitated by (1) securing funds for compelling research initiatives by HSRI subgroups such as through program projects; (2) actively recruiting the best and brightest graduate students and postdocs by showcasing the resources available to them in the health sciences; (3) hosting various means for members to communicate and interact around their research, such as through an annual HSRI symposium, visiting scholar presentations, seminars, and other regularly scheduled activities that bring members together; and (4) maintaining core facilities that will support research in the health sciences. Research facilitated by HSRI sponsored activities will solidify UCM as a leader of human health research, which will allow us to continue to attract top talent at the faculty, postdoctoral, and student levels. Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) The goal of the University of California’s Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) program is to educate California’s future leaders by preparing promising students for advanced education in science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM). The program is designed to identify upper division undergraduate students with the potential to succeed in these disciplines, but who have experienced situations or conditions that have adversely impacted their advancement in their field of study. Participants receive benefits such as research funding and summer room and board. Once chosen as UC LEADS Scholars, students embark upon a two year program of scientific research and graduate school preparation guided by individual faculty mentors.

Engineers create new ideas and then transform those ideas into products and services that improve people’s lives. As part of this creative process, engineers apply mathematics and the principles of the natural sciences to solve problems and meet the needs of society. Engineering spans the very small to the very large, from micro-sensors that can continuously monitor human health, to space stations that can support the exploration of new worlds. It also touches our everyday lives. Engineering has provided our shelter, our transportation, our entertainment, our medical supplies and technologies, our water supplies, the food we eat, the movies we watch, the appliances that make our lives easier and the protection of our environment. Engineering careers are among the highest in demand in the world including the United States and, as a result, provide great personal and professional satisfaction and quality of life. Engineering is a “people-serving profession” and a pathway to financial security. In short, engineering makes the world work! Now, more than ever, we need talented and highly creative people to participate in this exciting profession. Engineering is all about creating things that never were, transforming culture, and improving human lives and conditions around the world. At one of the youngest and most diverse universities in the country, engineering education at UC Merced is both challenging and satisfying.

Learn more here: admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/exam-requirement/ HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR GRADE-POINT AVERAGE The grade-point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before 12th grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four-point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before 12th grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during 12th grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level courses. Honors courses are Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and designated Standard Level courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school’s course list. Courses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade. No more than two units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 can be assigned extra points. D grades are not assigned extra points. Students who receive D or F grades in “a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or a more advanced level in the same subject. Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International Freshman Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international freshman applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade-point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 6.5. For more information visit Qualifying for Admission Review by Examination Alone You might be able to qualify for admission to the University by examination alone through achieving high scores on the ACT Plus Writing, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay and two SAT Subject Tests (excluding Mathematics Level 1). To be considered for admission to the University by examination alone, you must achieve a minimum UC Score Total of 410 (425 for nonresidents). In addition, you must earn a minimum UC Score of 63 on each component of the ACT, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay and on each SAT Subject Test. You cannot use a SAT Subject Test to meet these requirements if you have completed a transferable college course in that subject with a grade of C or better. For more information, visit universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/freshman/requirements/examination/ All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors can be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as freshmen: Academic GPA in all required “a-g” courses, including additional points for completion of University-certified honors courses. SAT/ACT scores and SAT Subject Tests are not required but can be considered if submitted. Number, content of and performance in academic courses beyond the minimum “a-g” requirements.

Academic accomplishments in light of your life experiences and special circumstances. If you enrolled in a regular session of college- or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a freshman. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges who have completed at least 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units). While preparing to transfer at the junior level, you must complete a pattern of courses that will prepare you for further study in your chosen major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available at admissions.ucmerced.edu/major-preparation If you are enrolled at a California Community College, you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower-division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman- and sophomore-level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition, you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the Transfer Credit Practices Section of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found at Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter-grade basis will be computed into the grade-point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your GPA. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. If you have attended only community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit, and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university can have up to 79 transferable semester (118 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer without a dean’s review. Applicants with 80 semester (120 quarter) units or more; a dean’s review is required. Transfer Credit Policy for University of California, Merced, Effective Fall 2014 The University of California, Merced, grants unit credit for college courses completed at United States regionally accredited colleges and universities; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Courses determined to be essentially the same as courses offered for an undergraduate degree at any UC campus will be granted credit, if the course: Is listed in the original institution’s catalog/website of official courses offered for the year in which the course was completed, and Includes the same or similar content, and Requires the same or similar prerequisite course work, and Is offered at the same level of instruction. Courses that further the student’s knowledge and understanding in fundamental liberal arts disciplines such as mathematics, natural science, literature, social sciences, fine arts and philosophy are acceptable for transfer if comparable in scope and depth to those offered at the UC. Courses accepted for transfer must be reported on an official transcript (academic record), which must be provided to UC Merced in a sealed envelope from the original college/university of enrollment, bearing the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. UC Merced can award lower-division (freshman/sophomore level) units for military courses completed if the courses are consistent with the University policy on granting transfer credit when there is an equivalent course taught at a UC campus. UC Merced will consult the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations for information regarding course content as a guide to the awarding of credit. work experience, military/recruit basic training, vocational or technical training, or remedial academic or personal enrichment courses. Remedial academic courses in English and mathematics are not transferable. Courses completed at unaccredited/nonregionally accredited institution could be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Courses from enrollment at another UC main campus (not UC Extension) during a regular academic (fall, winter or spring) or summer term are all transferable. Courses from enrollment at any UC Extension are transferable if the course is numbered 1-199; courses numbered 1-99 that include a campus designation (e.g. XB, XSB) are equivalent to the same course offered to undergraduates on that campus. UC Merced grants credit for examinations as follows: International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level GCE or Hong Kong Advanced Level (A-Levels) – unit credit could be granted for satisfactory grades and scores. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST) exams. Students will be granted up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any other institution or any combination of other institutions. For units beyond the maximum allowed, subject credit for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation will be granted and can be used to satisfy requirements. Units earned through AP, IB and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. Units earned at any UC campus (Extension, summer, cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. In addition, there is a limit to the number of units for which UC Merced grants credit in the following areas: English as a Second Language courses: Maximum 8 semester/12 quarter units Physical Education activity courses: Maximum 4 semester/6 quarter units UC Merced will not grant credit for college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously completed course, or examination for which credit has already been granted, with the exception of the repeat of deficient (D/F) course grades. Every California Community College has an agreement with the UC – a Transfer Course Agreement (TCA). The TCA specifies which courses receive UC credit. To learn if college courses from a California Community College are transferable to UC Merced, visit . These lists are updated throughout the year, so check ASSIST periodically to ensure you have the most current information. Other two-year and four-year Institutions: The UC does not have transfer course agreements with institutions other than the California Community Colleges. However, using ASSIST and/or referring to any UC campus’ general catalog can provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer to UC Merced. UC Merced does not grant credit for junior/community college programs that are technical or vocational, or programs that do not lead to further academic study at a university in the international country. Elementary/intermediate language courses: No credit is granted to students who were instructed in that language during secondary school. Final determination on the transferability of coursework for credit will be made by UC Merced’s Office of Admissions, based on UC Merced’s review (not that of another institution).

Adjacent to Lake Yosemite Park and just outside the city of Merced, UC Merced is continuing to develop in its convenient location at the center of California. Nestled between the Sierra Nevada range to the east and the Coast Ranges to the west, the over 800-acre campus is situated within a two-hour drive from San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and Sacramento; less than two hours from Yosemite National Park and other Sierra Nevada destinations; and an hour from Fresno. Even closer to campus, the surrounding communities in Merced, Stanislaus and Mariposa Counties offer a unique selection of cultural, entertainment and recreational options for students to experience. Full development of the campus is anticipated within three or four decades when UC Merced will serve an estimated 25,000 students. UC Merced students have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to help create the student life experience for the students who will follow. You are invited to add to campus traditions, create new student organizations and activities, and offer your ideas on student services, planning priorities and university growth and development. As a student at UC Merced, you can gain valuable skills through internships and service learning, expand your cultural and international awareness and understanding, develop your leadership potential and make lifelong friends through involvement in a variety of academic, student and recreation programs. Student government, intercultural and residential programs, intramurals, club sports and athletic teams, university events and a variety of clubs and organizations are among your many choices. Students also have access to a wide array of support services as well as academic, social, recreational and wellness activities. The first phase of campus development includes five academic buildings, in addition to housing and dining complexes, and the Joseph E. Gallo Recreation and Wellness Center. At the heart of the campus, featuring a library collection that blends books and bytes, the Leo and Dottie Kolligian Library is home to campus student services and administrative offices. It also is a welcoming meeting place for individual study, small group work and encounters with your friends. The majority of your classrooms and lecture halls are located in the Classroom Building, adjacent to the Carol Tomlinson-Keasey Quad. The Classroom Building features the 377-seat Lakireddy Auditorium, and other programmed space including teaching laboratories, and faculty and graduate student offices. The three-story Science and Engineering Building accommodates teaching in both wet and dry research laboratories and computing laboratories. The Social Sciences and Management Building houses faculty offices, research labs, art classrooms and exhibition space and classrooms. The Student Services Building, which will open in two phases starting in fall 2013, will house classrooms, offices and some students services. Future buildings on the over 800 acre campus include a second Science and Engineering Building, scheduled to open in 2014, a Classroom and Academic Office Building and additional student housing. In the neighboring city of Merced, students will find a small, vibrant community. Currently home to more than 80,000 residents, the city retains the charm of a small town—with short commute times—and many of the amenities of a larger community. Many educational, cultural and co-curricular activities connect students with the city of Merced and the surrounding region, and students are encouraged to experience the warmth of UC Merced’s host community and discover its treasures. Wandering through the pedestrian-friendly downtown is a good place to start. Brick paved walking areas, alleys decorated with murals and Italian trellises, an award-winning multicultural arts center, a community playhouse, the newly restored Merced Theater, and several historically significant buildings are among the features. Merced also is home to shops, restaurants, farmers markets and retail stores, with additional choices available in the nearby cities of Modesto and Fresno. Serving the San Joaquin Valley Through the 10th University of California Campus UC Merced’s history dates back to 1988, when the University of California Board of Regents first authorized planning for at least one additional campus based on projections of long-range enrollment demand. The Regents targeted the San Joaquin Valley as the region where the tenth University of California campus should be located. As one of the fastest-growing regions in the state, the Valley population was one of the most distant from the nine existing UC campuses. The Regents wanted to encourage more Valley students to attend the University and to extend the University’s role in contributing to the region. Locating UC Merced in the San Joaquin Valley has given the campus access to a rich natural laboratory for scientific and cultural research. UC Merced’s proximity to the Sierra Nevada has also led to creation of a special relationship for education and research with three crown jewels of the U.S. National Park Service: Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. Established in 1868, fewer than 20 years after California became a state, the University of California opened with 10 faculty members offering classes to 40 students the following year in Oakland. By 1873, the first academic buildings were completed on the UC Berkeley campus and the University moved to its new home. Today, the University of California serves more than 228,000 students and includes approximately 190,000 faculty and staff members. Encompassing 10 campuses, five medical centers, five law schools and a Statewide Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the University also manages three national laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy. The University has awarded more than 1.5 million degrees and has more than 1.2 million living alumni. A leading center for innovation for almost 150 years, the University of California has responded to the needs of California through research, education and public service, and has helped to transform the world. University of California faculty members and researchers are pioneers in fields as diverse as agriculture, biological sciences, engineering, the environment, the arts, economics, medicine and technology, and over 50 have garnered Nobel Prizes for their pioneering discoveries and advances of knowledge. Among the University’s current faculty are more members of the National Academy of Sciences than at any other university in the United States. University of California: An Economic Force in California The University also fuels the state and national economies through the creation of thousands of California jobs and billions of dollars in revenues, countless discoveries that improve our quality of life and research to support innovation in fields critical to the future of our country. Technology developed by the University powers many of the state’s top and emerging industries, and University of California faculty and alumni have founded or led such major companies as Chiron, Genentech, Intel Corp., Apple Inc. and Gap, Inc. A driving force in the daily life of Californians, the University is a critical source of civic leaders, social service programs and providers, and teachers at all levels of education. Teaching and research are strengthened within the University through an extensive network of laboratories, museums and galleries, UC Extension centers, and research and field stations, which provide valuable public service to the communities of California and the nation. The University of California further extends its resources to the public through its performing arts centers, athletic facilities and botanical gardens. With collections totaling more than 30 million volumes, the University’s libraries are yet another valuable public asset and are surpassed in size on the North American continent only by the Library of Congress collection. UC Academic Preparation Initiatives To K-12 And Community College Students Beyond its tripartite mission of teaching, research and public service, the University is committed to expanding the educational horizons of California’s students and is engaged in a growing number of initiatives to bolster achievement in the state’s schools and better prepare students for college. UC Merced’s academic preparation efforts, led by our Center for Educational Partnerships, connect with K-12 students through mentoring, tutoring, college advising and other academic programs, while community college students benefit from services that help them prepare for transfer to the University. The University of California’s school partnerships offer curriculum development, direct instruction and community engagement, sophisticated data analysis of required student tests and additional assistance for many of California’s lowest performing schools. For teachers and administrators, the University of California provides professional development opportunities designed to improve skills and effectiveness. Overall, the University of California’s K-12 academic preparation initiatives directly affect hundreds of thousands of students and educators each year. For further information on UC Merced’s Center for Educational Partnerships, please visit Governance of the University of California The University of California system is governed by the 26-member Board of Regents, including 18 general members appointed by the Governor. Charged with setting general policy and making budgetary decisions for the University, the Regents also appoint the UC President, the 10 campus chancellors and other top administrators. Authority for University-wide academic matters is delegated to the Academic Senate, which is composed of faculty members and administrative officers from throughout the University of California system. For each campus, a division of the University of California Academic Senate guides academic policy. Students also have the opportunity to participate in policy-making at both the campus-wide and system-wide levels. For information about UC Merced’s Academic Senate, please visit . For information on the University of California System, please visit UC Merced is using the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED™) system for all major campus development and construction. The LEED™ system provides a national standard for what constitutes a “green building.” Using these stewardship elements in campus development will have the following environmental, economic, health and community benefits: – 100% of the campus storm water flows into on site retention ponds that treat building and site contaminants. – Construction practices recycle and/or divert more than 90% of the job site waste from landfills, limit the distance that materials are transported to the site and incorporate recycled content materials and sustainable harvested wood products. – Buildings are designed to provide increased ventilation and use natural daylight, creating a more pleasant working environment inside. – Water reduction in the buildings and landscape will lower the use of potable water up to 50% above minimum state standards by using fixtures that conserve wastewater, waterless urinals, drought-tolerant planting for landscaping and deep root tubes for trees, which direct water straight to the roots and eliminate excessive watering. – Paints, carpets and composite woods with low volatile organic compounds have been selected as a means to reduce indoor contaminants that might irritate or harm the comfort and wellbeing of building occupants. – Campus buildings are designed to energy performance targets that are significantly better (30-60%) than required by California law (Title 24) and than found at other University of California campuses. The campus also employs a centralized heating and cooling strategy that significantly improves efficiency and shifts the electricity used for cooling to nighttime hours. This minimizes UC Merced’s impact on the state energy infrastructure. – UC Merced has installed an advanced building energy management and control system that allows centralized operation and monitoring of all building functions. This level of monitoring and control provides a unique opportunity to manage the campus efficiently and be a living laboratory for faculty and students to study and advance building energy science. Environmental Stewardship: Landscape Preservation Thanks to support from the State of California, the Virginia Smith Trust and groups such as the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and The Nature Conservancy, the creation of UC Merced will help protect an important part of California’s natural wetland and rangeland heritage. The Packard Foundation’s historic gift to UC Merced preserves more than 5,000 acres of vernal pool habitat next to the campus. Funding from the State of California has supported conservation easements, allowing continued grazing and preservation of thousands of acres of additional seasonal wetland habitat in eastern Merced County. As Founding Chancellor Carol Tomlinson-Keasey observed, “The creation of UC Merced provides an unparalleled opportunity for environmental preservation. Vernal pool habitat in eastern Merced County has been disappearing for decades. The preservation efforts undertaken as part of the creation of our campus will permanently protect thousands of acres of this sensitive habitat.” The campus is exploring opportunities to integrate education, research, conservation and recreation uses to promote the sustainability of UC Merced Conservation Land & Biological Resources. Environmental Stewardship: Recycling Program UC Merced has made a commitment to campus recycling and currently uses a “single stream” recycling methodology. The Environmental Health & Safety Office coordinates the recycling of all electronic waste, light bulbs, batteries, and cell phones per state and federal law. Campus green waste is sent to the local landfill for mulching and reuse. Facilities Management and Dining Services continue to work cooperatively to address food related waste and a pre-consumer food composting program is in the planning stages. The university is committed to increasing its percentage of recycled materials that are diverted away from the county landfill. Environmental Stewardship: Environmental Preferable Purchasing Program (EPP) EPP considerations are incorporated into the qualitative analysis of competitive bids and contract awards. Campus furnishings, equipment, supplies and services are procured with a cradle-to cradle focus on environmentally preferable characteristics from raw material acquisition in manufacturing through the entire life cycle. Some examples of campus EPP results include: wood furniture from renewable forests, campus office seating up to 99% recyclable with 44% recycled content, Energy Star office equipment, computers, water coolers; laundry equipment among the highest rated in energy and water efficiency; copy paper with a minimum of 30% recycled content, library stacks and dorm room bed frames are recycled steel; and locally grown food and food containers composed of sugar cane. UC Merced received the “Best Practices Award” for “Buy Recycled – Sustainable Operations” at the 2006 UC/CSU Sustainability Conference hosted by UC Santa Barbara. Planning and Designing for a Sustainable Campus and Community UC Merced’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) creates a development framework (land uses, circulation, and open space) to plan, design, build and operate the UC Merced campus at ever-increasing levels of sustainability. The LRDP establishes goals and policies that mandate the use of broad-based, innovative sustainable techniques in facility and infrastructure design and construction. It includes integration with the research initiatives and innovations that are part of the overall campus research program, particularly in the area of solar power and building energy management systems. ZERO NET ENERGY: Through efficiency and renewable energy production. ZERO WASTE: Divert from landfill all campus waste by reducing excess consumption and recycling to the maximum extent feasible. ZERO CARBON FOOTPRINT: Produce zero net carbon emissions and prevent as much carbon emissions as it produces. Create a unique architectural identity for the campus by employing passive environmental system, such as shading, orientation and roof configuration, as design features on campus buildings; use of sustainable materials; and designing campus buildings to employ renewable energy production systems. Design campus landscaping to emphasize regional natives, avoid invasive or allergenic species, and select plants that are compatible with campus infrastructure, developing a palette of approved plant, ground cover and tree lists, as well as landscape design guidelines. Considering its location in the San Joaquin Valley, UC Merced has the opportunity to access many foods locally, avoiding the environmental impacts of long-distance shipping while promoting the local economy. Products that are fresh, locally grown and produced, and environmentally friendly will be included in the campus’ food offerings. Composting of food wastes will be explored as well. UC Merced Dining is engaged in the campus’ sustainable stewardship practices and committed to educate customers to enhance sustainability of our food resource and minimize waste. Some practices at UC Merced dining include: • Responsible Purchasing (utilize local vendors, usage of green chemicals, biodegradable & compostable packaging, purchase from green businesses) • Cooking Practices (batch cooking, scratch cooking, utilization of leftovers) • Waste Reduction (commingled recycling, trash compacting, zero waste catering, biofuel from grease waste, pre-consumer composting, coffee grind composting) As the tenth campus of the University of California, UC Merced will achieve excellence in carrying out the University’s mission of teaching, research and service, benefiting society through discovering and transmitting new knowledge and functioning as an active repository of organized knowledge.

Staff and peer health educators also provide information on alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, sexual health, stress management, nutrition, body image and smoking cessation. We encourage students to become active partners in promoting their own health and well-being. Services include: consultation with medical service providers for injury, illness, or chronic health conditions; laboratory testing; medications, immunizations and injections; and health and wellness education. Most core services are covered by student services and health fees and are provided at no cost. There may be a cost for some laboratory work, radiology, pharmaceutical medication and immunizations. All registered graduate and undergraduate students may use Health Services and Health Promotion even if they opt out of the Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP). All services are confidential and offered to registered students. The H. Rajender Reddy Health Center houses Health Services, Health Promotion, and Counseling and Psychological Services in the Joseph Edward Gallo Recreation and Wellness Center. All registered graduate and undergraduate students attending the UC are required to have major medical health insurance as a non-academic condition of enrollment. Unless a student shows proof of prior insurance coverage and requests a waiver, the student is automatically enrolled in UC Merced’s Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) and billed through the student’s account. UC SHIP offers comprehensive and affordable health insurance. It supplements the Health Center’s medical services and provides for extended medical care, emergency services, hospitalization, specialty care and out-of area care while you are traveling. The program fee covers the cost of the UC Merced group insurance plan and program administration. A student who is covered by another health insurance may waive UC SHIP by demonstrating that the coverage is comparable to that provided under UC SHIP. The student must apply for a waiver of UC SHIP by the specified deadline. All registered students are eligible to utilize the campus health center even if UC SHIP is waived. For information on insurance, including the waiver process and deadline, refer to the Health Services web page at Mandatory Hepatitis B and MMR Requirement and Optional Immunizations The California State Health & Safety Code mandates that all students entering the University of California who are under the age of 19 years old must be immunized against or provide proof of immunity from the Hepatitis B virus prior to enrollment. In addition to the Hepatitis B requirement, UC Merced requires that all entering students have received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Students must provide Health Services with documentation demonstrating compliance with these immunization requirements prior to registration. The Center for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ) and the American College Health Association ( ) recommend the following additional immunizations for college students. They are not required but are strongly recommended: Menactra vaccine (for meningitis). Recommended for high risk students and as a consideration for all college students. Tetanus (Td). Booster at age 11-12 years old and every 10 years. Varicella (chickenpox). Two doses one month apart for those who never had chickenpox or if a blood test does not show immunity.

The Disability Services Office, located in the Kolligian Library, Suite 107, supports students with disabilities by providing them with opportunities to participate fully in the academic community at UC Merced. Students with varying types of disabilities, including (but not limited to) those with mobility, visual, hearing, learning, psychological and other medical conditions may be eligible for the provision of reasonable disability accommodations through this program. Students must take the initiative and contact Disability Services (DS) for a student intake appointment to begin the DS registration process. It also is recommended that students be prepared to provide documentation of disability in support of their request for DS accommodation services. Guidelines for documentation can be found on the UC Merced website under Disability Services. Documentation provided to the office is confidential and is used solely for purposes of determining the student’s eligibility and the appropriate accommodations to be made. It is the responsibility of the student to provide this documentation and, if necessary, to pay for the cost of the documentation provided, including the cost for professional assessments for disabilities. Academic accommodations are developed with the student and Disability Services as part of the interactive services planning process. Accommodation ensures that students have a fair and equal access to the academic learning environment. Accommodations are individualized and are determined on a case by case basis, based on the specific individual needs and recommendations included in each student’s documentation. An appropriate accommodation does not provide an unfair advantage, but rather minimizes the barriers caused by the disability. The most common types of accommodation services accessed by eligible students with disabilities may be one or a combination of alternative media services, communication services, mobility services, note taking services, proctoring and/or priority registration. The provision or use of a disability accommodation does not guarantee or ensure a certain level of academic achievement for the students. Students with disabilities must meet the same standards as all other students. Depending on the type of academic accommodation requested by the student, the approval of the appropriate School Dean may be required. Students with disabilities who need alternative media services, sign-language interpreting or CART should contact the Disability Services Office as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements for these services. It is the student’s responsibility to see that such notification occurs in a timely fashion. For further information, contact Disability Services by phone at (209) 228-6996, email: , TTY: (209) 228-TTY0 (8890) and/or fax: (209) 228-4542. Calvin E.

UC Merced - Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) Monday Through Friday, 7:30 AM – 4:30 PM (Open during lunch) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. In accordance with the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and campus procedures implementing the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the UC Merced campus of the University have the following rights: The right to inspect and review their own student records within 45 days of the date the University receives a written request for access. Students should submit their requests in writing to the University registrar, dean, or other appropriate campus official for the office having custody of the requested records. The request must identify the record(s) they wish to inspect and review. The campus official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the official receiving the request, that official shall advise the student of the correct official and redirect the request. The right to request the amendment of their own student records if a student believes the records are inaccurate or misleading. Students should submit a written request to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading to the campus official responsible for the record, clearly identifying the portion of the record they want changed, and specifying why it is believed to be inaccurate or misleading. If the University determines that the record should not be amended as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise him/her of the right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in their student records, except to the extent that law and policy authorize disclosure without consent. One exception permitting disclosure without consent is disclosure to campus officials having a legitimate educational interest in the records. A campus official is any individual designated by the campus to perform an assigned function on behalf of the campus. Legitimate educational interest means a demonstrated need to know by officials who act in a student’s educational interest. A campus official has a “legitimate educational interest” in a record if the official is performing a task: (a) specified in his or her job description; (b) specifically related to the official’s participation in the student’s education; (c) specifically related to the discipline of a student; or (d) specifically related to providing a service or benefit associated with a student or student’s family, such as health care, counseling, job placement or financial aid. Another exception permitting disclosure without consent is Directory (or public) Information, defined as information contained in a student record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed, unless the student has notified the Office of the Registrar that such information is to be treated as confidential with respect to him/herself. UC Merced has designated as public the following categories of information regarding students, which may be released to those requesting it: the student’s name, local address(es) and telephone number(s); UC Merced e-mail address; major field of study; dates of attendance; enrollment status (full-time, part-time); degrees and awards received; participation in officially recognized activities; and photographs. Parental/guardian information is confidential. It is used by the University only for notification of events, ceremonies, awards and development or in case of an emergency involving the student. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by UC Merced to comply with the requirements of the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act, addressed to the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20202-4605. Questions about these rights should be referred to the Registrar at UC Merced. Students who desire to withhold all information (including address, phone number and UC Merced e-mail address) from the category of public information must file a form in the Office of the Registrar by the tenth day of instruction. If a student does not choose this option, this information may be released and the student’s local address, phone number and UC Merced e-mail address will be included in the campus student directory. Students availing themselves of this right should understand what the consequences of such action might be. For example, if all information is designated nonpublic information, the campus cannot make public any Honors received by the student and cannot include the student’s name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the student’s written consent. Similarly, if all information is designated non-public information, the student’s status as a student or any degrees earned cannot be verified for potential employers without the student’s written consent. A student’s Social Security number is used to verify personal identity in the UC Merced student records system. Disclosure of Social Security number is mandatory. In compliance with state law, Social Security numbers are confidential and are not used as student identifiers."

It reflects mankind’s indomitable spirit of optimism that we can and must do better. Every human pursuit benefits from the ongoing process of evaluation and discovery. As the tenth campus of the University of California, UC Merced joins in the University’s unparalleled history of research accomplishments. That history also sets the high standards that UC Merced must live up to. As an undergraduate student at UC Merced, you will find faculty research enriching your education and your ability to analyze and critique information objectively. Exposure to research will help you to begin to define solutions to the weighty problems with which humankind will wrestle during your lifetime. Your courses will be continually enriched and invigorated by faculty discoveries, which reflect an ever-evolving curriculum. You will also have formal opportunities to participate in ongoing faculty projects, joining graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in labs, field work and other research settings. These opportunities will extend your classroom experiences and highlight the process of discovery that is critical to each discipline. You will not only learn the knowledge created in the past by others, but you will have the very real opportunity to create new knowledge that other students will learn in the future. As a graduate student you will plumb the depths of some of the world’s most challenging problems through your research and scholarly work. Graduate students work with faculty as apprentice scholars, building the skills needed to create and communicate discoveries in their field. The distinguishing feature of many of UC Merced’s graduate programs is their interdisciplinary nature, which provides a breadth of knowledge that helps put studies into a wider context. You will join a community of scholars and set your course for a career. Part of your research experience will include working closely with your faculty mentor and advisory committee as you build professional expertise and prepare for the future. To foster discovery that brings faculty insights from many disciplines together, UC Merced is structuring many of its research and graduate educational activities around research institutes composed of faculty from multiple schools. For further information about research at UC Merced, see Interdisciplinary Research Institutes And Programs The Center for Humanities, established in 2008, is designed around interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge. The Center seeks to recreate the Renaissance integration of multiple approaches to knowledge, encompassing the humanities, arts and qualitative social sciences. Theses areas of academic study share a concern with the ways in which human beings conceive, express, and enact their situations in and relations to societies, both local and, increasingly, global. The Center for Humanities provides spaces for discussion, conversation, and the extended pursuit of ideas. The shared concerns of various disciplines can be explored in ways that enrich research. By providing a context to challenge the self-validating paradigms of individual disciplines, the Center supports the divergent thinking that is the source of creative scholarship. In addition, we seek to make the significance of the enduring questions addressed by the humanities and arts more visible for both the campus and the community. The Center is part of the University of California Humanities Network, which incorporates the UC Society of Fellows in the Humanities, the University of California Humanities Research Institute, and the UC Consortium of Humanities Centers. The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) creates information technology solutions for many of our most pressing social, environmental, and health care problems. CITRIS was created “to shorten the pipeline” between world-class laboratory research and the creation of start-ups, large companies, and whole industries. CITRIS facilitates partnerships and collaborations among more than 300 faculty members and thousands of students from numerous departments at four University of California campuses (Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz) with industrial researchers from over 60 corporations. Together, the groups are thinking about information technology in ways its never been thought of before. UC Merced’s node of CITRIS engages faculty and students in a number of research efforts that occur at Merced alone as well as with the partner campuses in CITRIS. CITRIS investigators at UC Merced work in the areas of Energy, Democracy, Infrastructure and Health. CITRIS is also the home of UC Merced’s Mobile App Challenge. The mission of the Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI) is to promote all research in the human health sciences at UCM. Research perspectives within the HSRI currently include health psychology, medical anthropology, medical sociology, cognitive science, neuroscience, molecular cell biology, biochemistry, stem cell biology, bioengineering, and computational biology, involving faculty from all three schools. Human health issues are complex, requiring research from multiple perspectives. The HSRI promotes the organization of its member laboratories into synergistic teams, combining complementary disciplinary expertise to effectively tackle complex problems in human health. The formation of these inter- and multidisciplinary research teams is facilitated by (1) securing funds for compelling research initiatives by HSRI subgroups such as through program projects; (2) actively recruiting the best and brightest graduate students and postdocs by showcasing the resources available to them in the health sciences; (3) hosting various means for members to communicate and interact around their research, such as through an annual HSRI symposium, visiting scholar presentations, seminars, and other regularly scheduled activities that bring members together; and (4) maintaining core facilities that will support research in the health sciences. Research facilitated by HSRI sponsored activities will solidify UCM as a leader of human health research, which will allow us to continue to attract top talent at the faculty, postdoctoral, and student levels. Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) The goal of the University of California’s Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) program is to educate California’s future leaders by preparing promising students for advanced education in science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM). The program is designed to identify upper division undergraduate students with the potential to succeed in these disciplines, but who have experienced situations or conditions that have adversely impacted their advancement in their field of study. Participants receive benefits such as research funding and summer room and board. Once chosen as UC LEADS Scholars, students embark upon a two year program of scientific research and graduate school preparation guided by individual faculty mentors. Scholars are provided with an excellent opportunity to explore their discipline, experience a research environment, and improve their opportunities for future study in their chosen field. The Scholar gains valuable educational experience, the University a better prepared and more diverse graduate applicant pool, and the State, well-educated future leaders. Each Scholar is mentored by a member of UC the faculty, who assists the student in designing a plan of research and enrichment activities fitted to the individual interests and academic goals of the Scholar. This “Action Plan” includes: participation in the University-wide UC LEADS Symposium attendance at professional or scientific society meetings academic enrichment activities, including preparation for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) For further information, contact the Graduate Division. The mission of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI) is to discover and disseminate new knowledge that contributes to sustaining natural resources and promoting social well being in the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada regions of California, and related regions worldwide, through integrated research in the natural, social and engineering sciences.

A complete list of experiences that satisfy this requirement can be found To keep track of your learning, you will compile an ePortfolio. The purpose of the ePortfolio (which is part of CatCourses) is to give you a chance to review the development of your education. Every course that meets a GE requirement will have an assignment related to that requirement that you will upload into your ePortfolio on CatCourses. Students may add other projects if they wish. The portfolio will provide the basis for reflection on learning to be integrated into the culminating experience in the major; it will also be used to help you prepare for life after graduation. For Transfer Students: Satisfying General Education A transfer student is defined as someone who applies and is admitted as a transfer student for admissions purposes. In addition to meeting the transfer admissions requirements described by Undergraduate Admissions, transfer students should complete an acceptable general education course pattern and preparatory courses for the intended major, prior to transfer. Successful completion of general education and major preparation will assure that you do not need to take any additional lower division courses at UC Merced. Transfer students from a California Community College who complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) and transfer students from another University of California campus who complete lower division general education requirements, as documented in a Letter of Reciprocity* from that campus, will be considered to have satisfied the below general education requirements at UC Merced. Approaches to Knowledge A: Natural Science (2 courses) Approaches to Knowledge B: Social Science, Arts and Humanities (3 courses) *A Letter of Reciprocity is an official document from a UC campus that confirms that a student has satisfied all of the lower-division, general education and University requirements at that campus. California Community College classes articulate to UC Merced general education requirements as explained below. Information on articulation for California’s public colleges and universities may also be found at . These information sources can also provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer. Transfer courses must be completed with at least a C- (or equivalent).

While students are expected to contribute a certain amount toward their education, UC Merced offers a number of financial aid and scholarship resources to assist students in meeting their educational expenses. (Exceptions: The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships does not have funds available to offer assistance to students on special or limited status or students enrolled in University Extension.) All students, regardless of family income, are encouraged to apply for financial aid. In 2011-12 86 percent of UC Merced undergraduate students received some form of financial assistance. Financial aid is intended both to remove financial barriers for families who cannot afford the cost of a higher education and to fill in the gap for families who can afford only part of the cost. A number of factors in addition to family income are considered in determining your financial eligibility, including the size of your family and the number of family members in college. Although most grant awards are based on financial need, some loans and scholarships are available regardless of need. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is dedicated to helping students and their parents understand the financial aid opportunities available as well as the criteria used in determining eligibility for the various financial aid programs available at UC Merced. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships welcomes your questions and is here to provide services and guidance that will contribute to your educational experiences at UC Merced. If you have questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact our office or the Students First Center for assistance.

We have a variety of scholarships with a vast range of criteria available. There are merit-based and need-based scholarships for new and continuing students at all class levels. New students are automatically considered for all merit-only scholarships as well as need-based scholarships simply by completing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Continuing students need to submit a Continuing Student Scholarship Application by March 2nd of each year. Following is a partial list of scholarships that are available or will be available in the future for UC Merced students: Beverlee Sieghold Antoine Endowed Scholarship Fund Carol Tomlinson-Keasey Spirit of Leadership Award F.J. Cayting Friend of Education Scholarship and Fellowship Jefferson Jennings Doolittle Endowed Scholarship John C. “Jack” Pjerrou Endowed Scholarship Kris-Tangella Academic Excellence Endowed Scholarship Merced County Association of Realtors Scholarship Merced Mall Regional Shopping Center Scholarship Merced School Employees Federal Credit Union Endowed Scholarship Michael and Arline Colvin Endowed Scholarship Professor Roland Winston Endowed Scholarship Southern California Edison Fellowship/Scholarship Stephanie Rae Tomford Endowed Scholarship Stewart A.

Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need and do not have to be repaid. The Federal Government provides funds for Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The State of California also offers grants to qualified undergraduate students (Cal Grants A and B). In addition, grant funds are provided by the University of California. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, applicants must be U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, be enrolled as undergraduates, have not previously received a bachelor’s degree and demonstrate financial need. The amount you receive depends on your financial need as determined by completing the FAFSA. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants These are need-based grants provided to low-income undergraduate students to promote access to postsecondary education. Priority is given to students with exceptional financial need. To be eligible for a Cal Grant award, applicants must be California residents or meet the eligibility criteria for AB 540, demonstrate financial need and meet appropriate deadlines. The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) administers the Cal Grant program. Go to the CSAC website at awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant pays the majority of University fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. Cal Grant B pays a stipend each semester for living expenses for first-year students, and the majority of University fees plus a stipend each semester for living expenses for students in their second through fourth years. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. The University of California returns a portion of all tuition revenue to financial aid programs. UC Merced uses this funding to provide a need-based institutional grant and scholarship program (Bobcat Grants and Scholarships) to eligible students. The grant and scholarship program strives to ensure that all students who are eligible to attend the University of California, Merced, have the financial resources to do so. Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest loans. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning that the Department of Education provides the funding for this federal loan program. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school, but can defer any interest payment until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time working towards a degree. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. Students who are awarded a Federal Work-Study award are given the opportunity to earn money by working part-time. The Federal Work-Study award is NOT a guarantee of employment. Students will need to apply for and be hired into a Federal Work-Study position. Similar to a regular job, students are paid twice a month for the hours they work. This money may be used for any educationally related expenses that occur throughout the year. Students may only earn up to the amount they were awarded. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award on-line at: The Career Services Office is available to assist students in finding a Federal Work-Study position. Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the criteria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S.; be accepted for admission to the University; be enrolled in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted toward half- or full-time enrollment); demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans); maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; be registered for the selective service if the student is a male at least 18 years old, born after December 31, 1960, and not on active duty with the armed forces; and not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Please note: Financial need is the difference between the reasonable, approved expenses of attending UC Merced and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Undergraduate Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid eligibility, students must meet four standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, a minimum cumulative unit requirement and a maximum time-frame requirement. If a student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Students pursuing a double major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements; or the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. A student who has financial aid eligibility reinstated as the result of an appeal is placed on SAP probation and becomes subject to the terms of an academic plan. All work performed to regain eligibility under this SAP policy must be completed at UC Merced. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) will evaluate whether the student is adhering to the plan on a term-by-term basis. If the student has made up all deficiencies, he or she will no longer be considered on probation and instead will be considered an eligible student meeting the SAP requirements. Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. Requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCM Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. These requirements are separate and distinct from UC Merced’s policy regarding satisfactory academic progress set by The Office of the Registrar. Note: Some funds have higher academic and/or enrollment requirements. An undergraduate student will be ineligible for aid unless an appeal is approved if one of the following occurs: The student’s cumulative University of California grade point average is less than 2.0. All undergraduates must complete enough at least 66.6 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included All transfer credits UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). These pace calculations include all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e. independent study courses). Required remedial courses will count toward the graduate pace requirement. Quantitative Measurement (minimum unit requirement) Undergraduate financial aid applicants must comply with the following minimum unit requirements by the end of each academic year. 1 year attended - 1 full time term/1 part time term Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the unit requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). Transfer courses and required remedial courses will count toward the undergraduate student unit requirement. Only the transfer units earned during the academic year for which the Financial Aid SAP processing is being run will count. All undergraduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following year limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional years of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study (major) or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Students are allowed up to six years of financial aid eligibility, depending on their class standing when they are admitted. The initial class level is assigned by the Office of Admissions, based on transfer credits accepted, including Advanced Placement units. Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum year limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum year limit. Maximum Time-frame measure also includes all of the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Every term in which the student was enrolled with official part-time status is counted as a quarter-year of eligibility used. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached the maximum year limit. If a student attempts more than 9 units in summer, he will have used one half-year of eligibility. If a student attempts 9 or fewer units in summer, he will have used one quarter-year of eligibility. Accepted transfer units taken between (non-concurrent) enrollment at UC Merced will be added to the total number of transfer units the student has and will be used to determine remaining years of eligibility. Units taken while concurrently enrolled at UC Merced do not count as a separate year of eligibility. Students acquiring a second bachelor’s degree will have up to two years of additional Title IV financial aid eligibility (no institutional aid will be awarded), not to exceed eight years (six years of Title IV eligibility for the first bachelor’s and an additional two for the second bachelor’s). Appeal Process for Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress If a student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements; or if the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. Undergraduate students wishing to appeal must submit a UC Merced SAP Appeal to the UC Merced Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. All appeals must state the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances during the term(s) in question that hindered academic performance, such as prolonged hospitalization, death or extreme sickness in the family, etc. Supporting documentation of these extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarship once the appeal has been submitted electronically. Furthermore, students must submit, as part of the appeal, information regarding what has changed that would prevent a recurrence and would now allow them to reestablish the satisfactory academic requirements by the conclusion of the outlined time frame. As part of the appeal, students must propose how they will make up their deficiencies: If deficient in units, what they will do to ensure they pass the minimum number of units the following academic year to meet the minimum unit or pace requirements by the conclusion of the plan; If deficient in GPA, the minimum GPA required for each future term to eventually meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirement by the conclusion of the plan; If maximum number of terms of eligibility has been reached, the number of additional future terms required to complete degree requirements. In all circumstances, students must report which future terms of enrollment will be required to complete any and all academic deficiencies. Academic advisers will review and suggest academic plans for each appeal submitted. By suggesting a plan, an adviser ensures that, if followed, the plan will permit the student to meet the SAP requirements at the end of the plan’s duration. Students cannot apply retroactively for aid eligibility for a term that has ended. Deadline dates for each term are published annually on the financial aid website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If students notified, do not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a request in writing to the Office Financial Aid and Scholarships for consideration of a late appeal. Once received by the aid office, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Applications will be considered incomplete until satisfactory documentation is received. An email is sent to the student with instructions to submit the documentation to the OFAS. Once accepted, appeals will be evaluated by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email letter that the decision is final and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. If the appeal is approved, students will be sent an email notifying them to log into their SAP Appeal to view and accept the terms and conditions of their appeal. Note: if the terms and conditions are not accepted a student’s financial aid will not disburse. Graduate Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid eligibility, students must meet four standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, a minimum cumulative unit requirement and a maximum time-frame requirement. If a student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements; or if the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. A student who has his or her financial aid eligibility reinstated is placed on probation and becomes subject to the terms of an academic plan. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) will evaluate whether the student is adhering to the plan on a term-by-term basis. If the student has made up all of his or her deficiencies, he or she will no longer be considered on probation and instead will be considered an eligible student meeting the SAP requirements. Requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of all Federal Title IV financial aid apply to all applicants. These requirements are separate and distinct from UCM’s policy regarding satisfactory academic progress set by the Graduate Division or the Schools. Note: Some funds have higher academic and/or enrollment requirements. Graduate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA at the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All graduates must complete enough at least 66.6 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. All transfer credits UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e. independent study courses). Required remedial courses will count toward the graduate pace requirement. Graduate financial aid applicants must comply with the following minimum unit requirements by the end of each academic year: 1 year attended - 1 full time term/1 part time term Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the minimum cumulative unit/clock hour requirement for graduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). Required remedial courses will count toward the graduate student unit/clock hour requirement. All graduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following term limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional terms of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. MASTER’S DEGREE STUDENTS are eligible for financial aid for up to three years of academic year attendance following completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum term limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum term limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum term limit. If a student attempts more than 8 units in summer, he will have used one term of eligibility. If a student attempts 8 or fewer units in summer, he will have used a half-term of eligibility. Every term in which the student was enrolled with official part-time status is counted as a half-term of eligibility used. DOCTORAL STUDENTS may be eligible for financial aid for up to 7.5 years of academic year attendance following the completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum term limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum term limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum term limit. If a student attempts 9 or more units in summer, he will have used one term of eligibility. If a student attempts 8 or fewer units in summer, he will have used a half-term of eligibility. Every term in which the student was enrolled as official part-time status is counted as a half-term of eligibility used. Appeal Process for Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress If a student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements; or the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. Graduate students wishing to appeal must submit a UC Merced SAP Appeal to the UC Merced Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. All appeals must state the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances during the term(s) in question that hindered academic performance, such as prolonged hospitalization, death or extreme sickness in the family, etc. Supporting documentation of these extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships once the appeal has been submitted electronically. Furthermore, students must submit, as part of the appeal, information regarding what has changed that would prevent a recurrence and would now allow them to re-establish the satisfactory academic requirements by the conclusion of the outlined time-frame. In the appeal, students must detail how they will make up their deficiencies: If deficient in units, what they will do to ensure that they pass the minimum number of units the following academic year to meet the minimum unit or pace requirements by the conclusion of the plan; If deficient in GPA, the minimum GPA required for each future term to eventually meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirement by the conclusion of the plan; If maximum number of terms of eligibility has been reached, the number of additional future terms required to complete degree requirements. In all circumstances, students must report which future terms of enrollment will be required to complete any and all academic deficiencies. Students must consult with their academic counselors, as counselors must suggest an academic plan. By suggesting a plan, a counselor ensures that, if followed, the plan will permit the student to meet the SAP requirements at the end of the plan’s duration. Students cannot apply retroactively for aid eligibility for a term that has ended. Deadline dates for each term are published annually on financial aid website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If students notified, do not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a request in writing to the Office Financial Aid and Scholarships for consideration of a late appeal. Once received by the aid office, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Applications will be considered incomplete until documentation is received. An email is sent to the student with instructions to submit the documentation to the OFAS. Once accepted, appeals will be evaluated by the Dean of the Graduate Division or an appointed committee. The recommended decision will be communicated to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships for final approval. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email letter that the decision is final and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. If the appeal is approved, students will be sent an email notifying them to log into their SAP Appeal to view and accept the terms and conditions of their appeal. Note: if the terms and conditions are not accepted a student’s financial aid will not disburse. An undergraduate student withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: 1) the date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or 2) the date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or 3) UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who will be on a Planned Education Leave are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of his/her intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. For additional detailed information about Return to Title IV Funds at UC Merced, please see the “Return to Title IV Aid” guide available at the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. IMPORTANT WARNING: Your semesters of financial aid eligibility are limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave you use up one semester of eligibility! Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, Financial Aid proceeds are distributed to the student’s account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. This money will be applied towards institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate.

All universities aspire to educate the whole student. General education provides you with the practical skills and diverse knowledge base that you will need to become an informed citizen and a good problem solver after graduation. You will be entering the workplace in an era of rapid change; your future career may ultimately be in a field that doesn’t exist today. Through general education, you will craft for yourself the tools that will let you continue to grow in a world that demands lifelong learning for success. General education at UC Merced will help you grow intellectually by: Strengthening your abilities in quantitative reasoning and written, oral and other communication skills; and Introducing and teaching you to integrate broad domains of knowledge: arts and humanities, social and cognitive sciences, natural sciences, and technologies and engineering methods. Throughout your undergraduate years, UC Merced’s general education program will assist you to fine-tune your ability to communicate through words, numbers, images, and actions, and will enable you to discover the many ways in which knowledge is created and put to good use. General education at UC Merced places a high premium on demonstrating the ways in which different disciplines can make connections with each other. There also will be an emphasis on practicing and applying what you are learning in the classroom—an educational value also reflected in the undergraduate majors at UC Merced. The faculty has created a set of principles that embody the kinds of learning to be achieved through general education at UC Merced. You will encounter these principles in action through , a unique opportunity for all UC Merced first-year students to share a common exploration of the issues that will affect your future. Guiding Principles for General Education at UC Merced UC Merced’s educational experiences are designed to prepare well educated people of the 21st century for the workplace, for advanced education and for a leadership role within their communities. UC Merced graduates will be exceptionally well prepared to navigate and succeed in a complex world. The principles guiding the design and implementation of our academic program are envisioned within a continuum that ranges from preparatory and advanced curricula in general education and in the majors, through a variety of educational activities inside and outside the classroom. All UC Merced graduates will reflect these principles, which provide the foundation for their education: Scientific Literacy: To have a functional understanding of scientific, technological and quantitative information, and to know both how to interpret scientific information and effectively apply quantitative tools; Decision Making: To appreciate the various and diverse factors bearing on decisions and the know-how to assemble, evaluate, interpret and use information effectively for critical analysis and problem solving; Communication: To convey information to and communicate and interact effectively with multiple audiences, using advanced skills in written and other modes of communication; Self and Society: To understand and value diverse perspectives in both the global and community contexts of modern society in order to work knowledgeably and effectively in an ethnically and culturally rich setting; Ethics and Responsibility: To follow ethical practices in their professions and communities, and care for future generations through sustainable living and environmental and societal responsibility; Leadership and Teamwork: To work effectively in both leadership and team roles, capably making connections and integrating their expertise with the expertise of others; Aesthetic Understanding and Creativity: To appreciate and be knowledgeable about human creative expression, including literature and the arts; and Development of Personal Potential: To be responsible for achieving the full promise of their abilities, including psychological and physical well-being. The UC Merced general education program consists of courses that are informed by the Guiding Principles and that meet the following graduation requirements: In consultation with faculty, with advisors in the Student Advising and Learning Center, and with advisors in your School, you should keep track of your progress in fulfilling university, campus and school requirements for general education. University of California Entry Level Writing Requirement University of California Entry Level Writing Requirement (ELWR)/Analytical Writing Placement Exam To succeed at UC Merced, you must be able to understand and to respond adequately to written material typical of reading assignments in freshman courses, including being able to structure and develop an essay that uses written English effectively. Any student who has not yet satisfied this requirement through one of the alternatives listed below will be required to complete it by the end of the second semester of enrollment at UC Merced. Failure to complete this requirement in the time allowed will result in a hold on a student’s registration. After you enroll as a degree-seeking student at UC Merced, transfer work will not be accepted to meet the ELWR except by an appropriate course within UC approved by the Merritt Writing Program office. Students who leave UC Merced without satisfying ELWR and who return must complete the ELWR requirement at UC Merced. Students may satisfy the University of California Entry Level Writing Requirement in any of the following ways: Score 3 or higher on the College Board Advanced Placement Examination in English (Language or Literature); Score 30 or higher on the ACT combined English/Writing Test; Score 680 or higher on the College Board SAT Reasoning Test, Writing Section; Score 5 or higher on the International Baccalaureate Higher Level English A1 exam; Score 6 or higher on the International Baccalaureate Standard Level Examination English A1 exam; Prior to enrolling in the University, complete with a grade of C or better a transferable college course in English composition worth four quarter or three semester units; Achieve a passing score on the University’s writing proficiency examination, called the University of California Analytical Writing Placement Exam; or Complete an acceptable writing course at UC Merced ( The University offers the University of California Analytical Writing Placement Exam each spring on the second Saturday in May at test centers throughout the state for students who plan to enroll in the University the following fall. California residents who will enter the University as freshmen must take the exam if they have not otherwise satisfied the requirement (by one of the methods listed above). Students must pay a nonrefundable fee to cover test administration costs. Students who received admission application fee waivers will automatically have this fee waived. Admitted freshmen will receive detailed information about the exam in April. Students who are not from California may take an equivalent exam in the fall after enrolling at the University. Comprehensive information about the University of California Entry Level Writing Requirement and Analytical Writing Placement Exam is available at American History and Institutions Requirement As a candidate for an undergraduate degree at UC Merced, you need to demonstrate knowledge of American history and of the principles of American institutions under the federal and state constitutions. You may meet the requirement by completing specific courses or earning a certain score on an examination. Transfer students are urged to complete the requirement before they enroll. You may satisfy both the American History and American Institutions requirements in the following ways: Complete in high school one year of United States history with grades of C or better, or one semester of United States history and one semester of United States government with grades of C or better; Achieve a score of 3, 4 or 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Examination in U.S. History; Achieve a score of 550 or better on the SAT II: U.S. History test; Complete acceptable course work at a community college or other accredited institution; or Complete acceptable course work at UC Merced (both College-level mathematics/quantitative reasoning course The World at Home—Planning for the Future in a Complex World The CORE Course is future-oriented, striving to help students gain the intellectual tools, knowledge and insights they will need as informed citizens devising future solutions to real-life problems. The UC Merced CORE Course aims to understand the world at large as it is reflected in the world at home—California. By examining, for example, the local evidence of global problems, you will begin to grapple with the issues that will affect you personally and professionally. is a first year course that will pose a set of questions as they are framed by the various domains of human knowledge known as the disciplines. In , UC Merced faculty will introduce you to how their disciplines define the challenges faced by informed citizens of this new century. Can advances in technology mitigate the effects of burgeoning populations and resource depletion? How will a changing climate affect the future migration of human populations? How do citizens decide among conflicting ethical choices, each with a compelling claim? Faculty from all three Schools will join together to show how such complex questions might best be probed through connecting the insights of their disciplines. work together in groups on joint projects or problems to build your leadership and teamwork abilities; learn to think analytically and communicate effectively in the context of problems affecting your lives and futures; and use quantitative methods as well as ethical judgment to make decisions and defend those decisions to your peers; A grade of C- or better is required to pass The CORE Course is College One’s unique way to introduce you to how the disciplines understand problems and devise tools to grapple with them. Faculty from all three schools—Natural Sciences, Engineering, and Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts—challenge freshmen to think about ways that academic disciplines connect or debate with one another. CORE Friday is part of what makes unique. CORE Friday events round out the week’s lectures and discussions with a film, documentary, panel discussion, theatrical production or distinguished speaker. CORE Friday programming illuminates ideas presented during the lectures for the week, as well as alternative views. Analytical writing is a means for understanding better what you are learning and conveying your ideas to different audiences: your instructors, your fellow students and people outside the university. The lower division writing requirement will start you on a path of writing development that will continue through your four years at UC Merced. is designed to help you develop your college-level skills in effective use of language, analysis and argumentation, organization, and strategies for creation, revision and editing. It must be completed during your freshman or sophomore year. All students will take a college-level mathematics/quantitative reasoning course. For some of you, mathematics and statistics will be an essential tool for mastering a field in depth. For others, you will build your ability to understand how quantitative methods are applied in society to support arguments and solve problems. A variety of courses will be available to meet this requirement, based on your field of interest. Check the requirements of the major that interests you, in the School section of the catalog, for information on courses that satisfy Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning. The Schools of Engineering, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts each have a set of general education requirements to be completed if you choose a major offered by that School. School requirements include courses to help you build the collateral knowledge and skills you will need in order to succeed in your major. School requirements also include courses to help you understand the broad domains of knowledge. Check the School section of this catalog for specific requirements. For Transfer Students: Satisfying General Education In addition to meeting the transfer admissions requirements described in the section of this Catalog, transfer students should complete an acceptable general education course pattern and preparatory courses for the intended major, prior to transfer. Successful completion of general education and major preparation will assure that you do not need to take any additional lower division courses at UC Merced. For detailed information on how transfer students can satisfy lower division general education and major preparation requirements, see the Catalog section of the School that offers your intended major. Please note the following: California Community College transfer students who complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) satisfy all lower division general education requirements at UC Merced. For further details, see the Catalog section of the School that offers your intended major. Transfer students from other University of California campuses who have completed lower division general education requirements at the UC campus have satisfied lower division general education requirements at UC Merced. Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) Examinations The University awards credit for successful completion of the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) and the International Baccalaureate Higher Level Examinations (IB). Students must have official test score reports sent directly from the testing service to UC Merced to receive credit. Students will meet with advising staff during New Student Orientation to discuss which courses or requirements they may have satisfied based on transfer credit for scores in these examinations. UC Merced grants elective credit for all College Board AP examinations on which a student scores 3 or higher. Some examinations passed with scores of 3 or higher may award exemptions for degree requirements. The number of elective units awarded for each examination can be viewed on the chart in this section. The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) awards either a diploma or awards a certificate for individual IB exams. Students completing the IB diploma with a score of 30 or above will receive a total of 20 semester units of elective credit toward their UC Merced undergraduate degree. To complete the IB diploma, students are required to take one subject from each of the six subject groups and complete an extended essay. At least three of the six subjects must be taken at the Higher Level. The University grants 5.3 semester units to students who receive IB certificates for each individual Higher Level Exam on which the student scores 5, 6, or 7. The University does not grant credit for Subsidiary level examinations. The number of units awarded for each examination can be viewed on the chart in this section. Potential Duplication of Credit for AP and IB Exams Credit will be granted for either the AP or IB examinations in any one subject area. College courses taken prior to or after enrolling at the university may duplicate the content of AP or IB examinations. In these cases, the university may not award credit for both the course and the AP or IB examination credit. The following chart provides guidelines used for awarding units (elective credit) and exemptions for degree requirements. Credit will be granted for either the IB or AP Exams in any one subject area.

https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/content.php?catoid=2&navoid=44,About the Catalog - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™,"About the Catalog - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™ School of Social Sciences, Humanities & Arts Ernest and Julio Gallo Management Program Office of Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Physical Operations, Planning and Development UC Merced is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Official degree and major requirements are listed in this catalog. Undergraduate and graduate students are subject to requirements based on a particular catalog, referred to as the student’s “catalog year.” The catalog year is determined for new students as the catalog in effect at the time of their initial enrollment in courses at UC Merced, provided there is no break of more than 3 consecutive terms (e.g., 2 semesters and 1 summer) in enrollment. It is campus policy to introduce changes in graduation requirements such that students who began their careers with UC Merced before the change will not be hindered substantially in the orderly pursuit of their degrees. Changes in requirements that increase the number or distribution of courses required normally will not be applied to students with earlier catalog years, provided there is no break in enrollment exceeding 3 terms. The student’s catalog year determines both the major and general education requirements for degree completion. Students may elect to adhere to a different catalog year if they wish to follow the general education and major requirements listed in a catalog published subsequently to that which was in place at the time of their initial enrollment; the student must note this in a petition to his or her School. Students transferring from other institutions may elect either (1) those major requirements in effect at the time of transfer to UC Merced; or (2) those in effect up to two years prior to matriculation, provided that their transcripts from earlier schools indicate commitment to the major within that period and that they have adequate preparation for upper-division coursework. Undergraduate and graduate students who have made significant progress toward a degree in a specific major can assume that a degree will be granted if they meet all catalog degree requirements and maintain continuous enrollment and progress. Should UC Merced find it necessary to discontinue a specific major, every effort will be made to allow currently enrolled majors to complete their degrees within a reasonable period of time. This may include (1) movement to a similar or related degree track; (2) substitution of requirements; (3) development of an individual major proposal; or (4) completion of courses at another University of California campus through the Intercampus Visitor Program. Students with questions concerning this policy should contact their major and school advising offices. In all cases, any financial obligations are the responsibility of the individual student involved. The University of California, in accordance with applicable federal and state laws and University policy, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, age, medical condition (cancer-related), ancestry, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation or status as a Vietnam-era veteran or special disabled veteran. The University also prohibits sexual harassment. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission, access and treatment in University programs and activities. Inquiries regarding the University’s student related nondiscrimination policies may be directed to Student Judicial Affairs. Sexual harassment of all persons who participate in University programs and activities is prohibited by law and by University regulation (Policy 380-12). Sexual harassment is unacceptable and will not be condoned on the UC Merced campus. This catalog contains information about UC Merced. Because the UC Merced Catalog must be prepared well in advance of the years it covers, changes in some programs and courses inevitably will occur. The selection of courses to be offered each semester is subject to change without notice, and some courses are not offered each year. The Schedule of Classes, available on the Web shortly before registration begins, provides more current information on courses, instructors, enrollment procedures and restrictions, class hours, room assignments, and final examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate School or campus unit for even more up-to-date information. Their contact information can be found in the contact information section of this catalog. It is the responsibility of the student to become familiar with the announcements and regulations of the university that are printed in this catalog and other campus publications. The catalog is the document of record for degree requirements and is updated in print form every two years. For the most up-to-date information on requirements, please visit:"

It reflects mankind’s indomitable spirit of optimism that we can and must do better. Every human pursuit benefits from the ongoing process of evaluation and discovery. As the first research university to be built in the 21st century, UC Merced is positioned for new approaches to research in support of the university’s mission. As the tenth campus of the University of California, UC Merced joins in the University’s unparalleled history of research accomplishments. That history also sets the high standards that UC Merced must live up to. As an undergraduate student at UC Merced, you will find faculty research enriching your education and your ability to analyze and critique information objectively. Exposure to research will help you to begin to define solutions to the weighty problems with which humankind will wrestle during your lifetime. Your courses will be continually enriched and invigorated by faculty discoveries, which reflect an ever-evolving curriculum. You will also have formal opportunities to participate in ongoing faculty projects, joining graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in labs, field work and other research settings. These opportunities will extend your classroom experiences and highlight the process of discovery that is critical to each discipline. As a graduate student you will plumb the depths of some of the world’s most challenging problems through your research and scholarly work. Graduate students work with faculty as apprentice scholars, building the skills needed to create and communicate discoveries in their field. The distinguishing feature of UC Merced’s graduate programs is their interdisciplinary nature, which provides a breadth of knowledge that helps put studies into a wider context. You will join a community of scholars and set your course for a career. Part of your research experience will include working closely with your faculty mentor and advisory committee as you build professional expertise and prepare for the future. To foster discovery that brings faculty insights from many disciplines together, UC Merced is structuring many of its research and graduate educational activities around research institutes composed of faculty from multiple schools. For further information about research at UC Merced, see Interdisciplinary Research Institutes And Programs The mission of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI) is to discover and disseminate new knowledge that contributes to sustaining natural resources and promoting social well being in the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada regions of California, and related regions worldwide, through integrated research in the natural, social and engineering sciences. The mission of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute is accomplished through: Collaborative, multidisciplinary, fundamental research conducted by faculty, students, staff and affiliated scientists in natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Strong interactions with related research units within the UC system and close collaborative relations with scientists and managers at national laboratories, and local, state and federal agencies, including the National Park Service. Connecting objective, science-based data and information with public and private stakeholders. The Sierra Nevada Research Institute is organized around an Environmental Systems model. A particular emphasis is on the physical and biological connections that exist between the Central Valley and Sierra ecosystems. Through these balanced research efforts, the Sierra Nevada Research Institute serves as a source of objective scientific information for public policy makers as California faces the growing challenge of sustaining the integrity and quality of its resources into the future. Through the Sierra Nevada Research Institute our students and faculty have access to a variety of biological field stations in Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks. In May 2004, Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada Research Institute dedicated the first of these stations, located in Wawona. The Wawona station gives logistical support for academic field research and outreach activities in Yosemite National Park. In addition, the Virginia Smith Trust Reserve adjacent to the UC Merced campus provides additional sites for research. UC Merced faculty currently affiliated with the Sierra Nevada Research Institute are working on climate change and ecosystem health, contaminant transformations in soils and aquatic systems, development of environmental sensors, hydrologic processes in the Sierra Nevada, nutrient transport in agricultural and natural systems, water and air quality in the Valley basin and Sierra Nevada Range, and computational ecology and biodiversity. For additional information on SNRI, see The mission of the Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI) is to promote all research in the human health sciences at UCM. Research perspectives within the HSRI currently include health psychology, medical anthropology, medical sociology, cognitive science, neuroscience, molecular cell biology, biochemistry, stem cell biology, bioengineering, and computational biology, involving faculty from all three schools. Human health issues are complex, requiring research from multiple perspectives. The HSRI promotes the organization of its member laboratories into synergistic teams, combining complementary disciplinary expertise to effectively tackle complex problems in human health. The formation of these inter- and multidisciplinary research teams is facilitated by (1) securing funds for compelling research initiatives by HSRI subgroups such as through program projects; (2) actively recruiting the best and brightest graduate students and postdocs by showcasing the resources available to them in the health sciences; (3) hosting various means for members to communicate and interact around their research, such as through an annual HSRI symposium, visiting scholar presentations, seminars, and other regularly scheduled activities that bring members together; and (4) maintaining core facilities that will support research in the health sciences. Research facilitated by HSRI sponsored activities will solidify UCM as a leader of human health research, which will allow us to continue to attract top talent at the faculty, postdoctoral, and student levels. Further information on HSRI is available at University of California Advanced Solar Technologies Institute The University of California Advanced Solar Technologies Institute (UC Solar) is a multi-campus, multidisciplinary research institute made up of faculty from the University of California’s Merced, Berkeley, and Santa Barbara campuses. Headquartered at UC Merced, UC Solar creates technologies that make solar energy systems more efficient, more affordable, and the best choice for the people of California and the world. In addition, UC Solar educates and develops tomorrow’s solar energy leaders and entrepreneurs. Initial UC Solar research areas include advancing the state-of-the-art in solar concentration (for photovoltaic and thermal systems), employing nanotechnology in both collector/concentrator and device structures, and developing new devices that capture usable energy in the UV portion of the solar spectrum. Through collaboration with industry and other stakeholders, UC Solar researchers are challenged to create solar technologies that can be brought to the marketplace quickly. UC Solar researchers partner with industry participants through the UC Solar Industry Consortium, which attracts companies that design, produce, implement, manage and invest in solar technologies. The UC Solar website provides additional information about the Institute, see Center for Research in the Humanities & Arts The Center for Research in the Humanities & Arts (CRHA), established in 2008, is designed around interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge. The Center seeks to recreate the Renaissance integration of multiple approaches to knowledge, encompassing the humanities, arts and qualitative social sciences. Theses areas of academic study share a concern with the ways in which human beings conceive, express, and enact their situations in and relations to societies, both local and, increasingly, global. The Center for Research in the Humanities & Arts provides spaces for discussion, conversation, and the extended pursuit of ideas. The shared concerns of various disciplines can be explored in ways that enrich research. By providing a context to challenge the self-validating paradigms of individual disciplines, the Center supports the divergent thinking that is the source of creative scholarship. In addition, we seek to make the significance of the enduring questions addressed by the humanities and arts more visible for both the campus and the community. The Center is part of the University of California Humanities Network, which incorporates the UC Society of Fellows in the Humanities, the University of California Humanities Research Institute, and the UC Consortium of Humanities Centers. The goal of the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SpARC) Centralized Research Center is to add value and capabilities to UC Merced’s existing and planned research, teaching, administrative, and community outreach efforts in the area of spatial analysis and spatial science. Many UC Merced faculty are engaged in spatial sciences including historians and archaeologists, social and cognitive scientists, engineers, computer scientists, environmental scientists, and biologists. SpARC’s mission extends across all three academic Schools and has connections with the Sierra Nevada Research Institute, the Great Valley Center, Yosemite National Park, the Center for the Study of Health Disparities, and the Division of Administration. SpARC aims to foster new intellectual collaboration, stimulate new sources of funding, further innovative and original research, supply research techniques and services to faculty groups, perform services and outreach to the public and support student learning."

Accordingly, final approved levels (and thus a student’s final balance due) may differ from the amounts shown. This mandatory fee supports the Student Health Center, the on-campus medical facility. This mandatory fee supports CatTracks and parking infrastructure. This mandatory fee supports educational, social, multicultural, and skill building activities and events that aid in the growth and development of students. A different amount for undergraduate and graduate students, this mandatory fee supports student government associations. This mandatory fee supports the recreation center and related sports activities. : This mandatory fee supports competitive sports on campus. It also supports existing club sport teams and the intermural sports program. This mandatory fee supports events and operations of the Campus Activities Board, which was created to provide a variety of entertainment, co-curricular programming, and social activities for the UC Merced student body.

As a non-academic condition of enrollment, all students must purchase Student Health Insurance (SHIP) or request a waiver of this fee. The Fall undergraduate SHIP provides coverage from August through December; the Spring SHIP provides coverage from January through August. The fall 2013 undergraduate fee is $709.00, and the graduate fee is $838.00. The spring 2014 undergraduate fee is $992.00, and the graduate fee is $1,173.00. Graduate students who wish to cover spouses, domestic partners or children should contact Health Services at Students may be charged fees in some courses for the use, rental or consumption of materials, tools or equipment, or for the costs of materials or services necessary to provide a special supplemental educational experience. For example, course materials and services fees may cover the cost of chemicals and glassware for a science laboratory or art supplies for a studio class. They also might cover film rentals, field trips or the purchase/rental of specific equipment. Reduced fees are available to UC career employees and certain UC retirees who are eligible for admission to the university. Once admitted, the employee-student must file a petition for the reduction in fees before each semester of enrollment. Employee-students pay one-third of the full-time student services fee and one-third of full-time tuition. No campus based fees are charged and those services are not available to Employee students. Employee students may enroll for up to nine (9) units or three (3) courses per semester, whichever provides the greater benefit to the employee. Employees who are eligible to receive reduced fees under this policy are not eligible to receive an additional reduction in fees under the policy on Part-Time Study. Students approved for enrollment on a part-time basis pay the same student services fees as full-time students, but pay only one-half of full-time tuition. Undergraduate students must file a petition for part-time study with the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students must file their petition with the Division of Graduate Studies. For more information on the eligibility requirements for part-time study, please see the Registration at UC Merced is a two-step process: (1) students register for classes and (2) the University assesses fees. You must register for classes first so that your fees can be assessed. You must then pay your fees prior to the fee payment deadline. A failure to pay fees in full by the fee payment deadline will result in you being dropped from courses for non-payment. Additionally, a $50 late payment fee will be assessed and a hold will be placed on your account, limiting your access to University services. Accordingly, your academic transcripts will not be released until the delinquent account balance is paid. Note: the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) fee is part of registration fees and is due and payable, unless waived, at the time registration fees are due. Electronic billing statements are published the first business day of each month. If you register just prior to the semester fee payment deadline, do not wait for a billing statement to pay your fees. Fees are due and payable by the published deadline whether or not a billing statement has been produced. Your billing statement will list recent charges and credits. Charges include registration fees, housing charges and any additional billable services. Credits include payments and financial aid disbursements. If you are a financial aid recipient, aid will be applied to allowable charges on your account and any excess will be refunded to you. You are responsible for the timely payment of any charges not covered by your financial aid. The following may occur when a payment is late: A hold may be placed on your account impacting your ability to access services (such as subsequent term registration, transcripts, etc.); You may be dropped from your classes for non-payment; Per section 15 of the Housing contract, the University may initiate termination of tenancy proceedings, which can lead to eviction. . Students can pay their account balance at this site using MasterCard, American Express, Discover or E-Check. Students can make payments in person at Campus Cashiering Services, located in Kolligian Library next to the Students First Center. Their hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Friday. They are closed all campus holidays. Make your check payable to the UC Regents and note your student ID number in the memo field of the check. Mail the check to the following address: The Deferred Payment Plan (DPP) offers students the option to pay registration fees and student housing contract amount (if applicable) in three monthly installments per semester. Students receiving sufficient financial aid to cover their registration fees and room and board costs do not qualify for the plan. To qualify for the UC Merced DPP, you must have a semester account balance of $500.00 or greater after any authorized financial aid has been posted to your student account. If eligible, your first installment payment amount will be 40% of the semester account balance. The second and third installments will be 30% each. The University charges a non-refundable participation fee of $40.00 per semester. This fee will be billed to your student account when your DPP enrollment request is approved. DPP enrollment must be requested each semester - a fall DPP enrollment does not carry over to the spring semester. Due dates for DPP installment payments are: For more information about the DPP, please visit the DPP page of the SBS website at You must pay all prior delinquent debts prior to registering. An additional charge will be made for failure to pay required fees or deposits by the dates announced. If you enroll in courses after the enrollment deadline, you may be assessed a late enrollment fee and possibly, a late payment fee. The University accepts personal checks as payment on student accounts. However, when a check is not honored by the payer’s bank the University charges a $20 Returned Check Fee to the respective student account. The University will refuse to accept a personal check from a person who is a repeat offender. Any person who has more than two unpaid checks returned to the University is placed on a cash-only basis for all future transactions (i.e. cash, cashier’s check, money order, or payment via the web). A letter will be mailed to the student’s current mailing address indicating that personal checks will no longer be accepted. To cancel registration before the first day of instruction or to withdraw from the University on or after the first day of instruction, you must complete a Cancellation/Withdrawal form and return the form to the Students First Center. If you do not submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form, you will be liable for fees according to University policy. It is very important that you contact the Students First Center and initiate withdrawal/leave of absence procedures even if your fees are fully paid by financial aid or other programs. Failing to do so may result in you owing money to the University. The effective date for determining a refund is the date a completed Cancellation/Withdrawal form is received by the Students First Center. Upon submitting a Cancellation/Withdrawal form a student enrolled in classes will be dropped from those classes. The percentage of fees that may be refunded is determined by the number of calendar days (not school days) elapsed, beginning with the first day of instruction for the semester. The $100 deposit paid with the Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) is not refundable. Failure to submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form: If you are not a financial aid recipient and you fail to submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form to the Students First Center, you will be presumed to have attended school the entire semester and full fees will be assessed and due. If you are a financial aid recipient, you must contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships for information on how this will affect you. New Students Who Receive Title IV Federal Financial Assistance and Withdraw During their First Academic Term: Federal regulations require UC Merced to calculate the amount of federal financial aid that has been “earned” for all students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UC Merced during a semester. If the student withdraws prior to completing 60 percent of the semester, a pro-rated portion of the aid must be returned to the federal government. Any portion of unearned aid that must be returned to federal aid programs by UC Merced will be deducted from the amount of the tuition and fee refund. If the amount UC Merced must return to federal aid programs exceeds the amount of the student’s institutional refund, the student’s account may be billed for the balance. All students will be assessed the health insurance fee. However, students who already have adequate health insurance should request a waiver of this fee. If you have paid the health insurance fee and cancel all course registration on or before the first day of instruction, you are entitled to a full refund of this fee. Insurance fees are not refundable after the first day of instruction and coverage remains in effect until the date specified by the insurance plan. Charges other than the student services fee, tuition, nonresident supplemental tuition and campus-based fees are refunded according to guidelines and schedules published by the appropriate department."

How to Calculate Your Grade Point Average The grade point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before twelfth grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before twelfth grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during your twelfth grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level and Advanced Placement courses taken in grades 10 – 12 and passed with grades of C or above: A=5 points, B=4 points and C=3 points. No more than 2 units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 may be assigned extra points. Grades of D are not assigned extra points. The courses must be in the following “a-g” subjects: history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science and visual and performing arts. In these fields, as well as in the fields of computer science and social science, courses that are designed to prepare students for Advanced Placement Examinations, the International Baccalaureate Higher Level Examination and college courses that are transferable to the University are acceptable honors-level courses. Students who receive D and F grades in ”a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or more advanced level in the same subject. Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International Freshman Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international freshman applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 7. For more information visit Qualifying for Admission Review by Examination Alone You may be able to qualify for admission to the University by examination alone through achieving high scores on the ACT Assessment plus Writing or SAT Reasoning Test and two SAT Subject Tests (excluding Mathematics Level 1). To be considered for admission to the University by examination alone, you must achieve a minimum UC Score Total of 410 (425 for nonresidents). In addition, you must earn a minimum UC Score of 63 on each component of the ACT or SAT Reasoning Test and on each SAT Subject Test. You cannot use a SAT Subject Test to meet these requirements if you have completed a transferable college course in that subject with a grade of C or better. For more information, visit universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/freshman/requirements/examination/ All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors may be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as freshmen: Academic grade point average in all required “a-g” courses, including additional points for completion of University-certified honors courses.

If you enrolled in a regular session of college or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a freshman. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges, who have completed at least 60 UC- transferable semester units (90 quarter units). While preparing to transfer at the junior level, you complete a pattern of courses that will prepare you for further study in your chosen major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available . If you are enrolled at a California Community College you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman and sophomore level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. Transferable College Units and Grade Point Average (GPA) The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found on the website: Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter grade basis will be computed into the grade point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your grade point average. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university may have up to 80 transferable semester (120 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer. Transfer Credit Practices for Undergraduates – University of California, Merced UC Merced grants transfer credit from institutions that are accredited by U.S. regional accreditation commissions, specifically: the New England, North Central, Middle States, Southern, Northwest and Western associations. Course credit from institutions in other countries will be considered if the institutions are authorized to grant baccalaureate degree credit and are recognized by the country’s Ministry of Education. Courses accepted for transfer credit must be reported on a currently dated, official transcript, in a sealed envelope from the original college/university of enrollment, bearing the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. Courses determined to be essentially the same as courses offered for undergraduate degree credit at any UC campus will be considered transferable for unit and/or subject credit to UC Merced. Courses considered transferable must be listed in the home institutions’ catalog, be designed for the same or similar program as at UC, in the same or similarly named academic department, at the same level of instruction, requiring the same prerequisite coursework and including the same or very similar course content. Except for courses taken at other UC campuses, transfer work does not affect the UC Merced grade point average. Transfer work cannot be applied to the senior residency requirement. Transfer courses submitted to meet academic major requirements must be posted as letter grades on the transcripts from the original college/university of enrollment. Degree requirement exemptions, satisfaction or partial satisfaction is determined by academic departments and UC Merced schools after final, official transcripts from all colleges, universities, and examination agencies are received, reviewed and verified by UC Merced. New students: transcripts must be sent to the Office of Admissions. Continuing students’ transcripts must be sent to the Office of the Registrar. Community Colleges (2 year institutions) – Articulation Agreements No more than 70 semester units of community college coursework can be applied toward the 120 unit graduation requirement. It is possible, however, to satisfy course requirements with community college coursework in excess of this limit. Credit for courses beyond the 70 unit limit is referred to as “subject credit only.” For California Community Colleges, check for course transferability and requirement equivalencies at . ASSIST is the official repository for UC Merced articulation agreements. There is no limit to the number of units that can be applied toward the 120 unit graduation requirement from a four-year institution. However, opportunities to enroll at UC Merced are limited for students who have exceeded 80 semester units of transferable credit. Prospective transfer students are encouraged to contact UC Merced admissions advisors for help in developing a transfer plan. Transfer applicants who exceed 80 semester units of transfer credit will be considered for admission on an individual, case by case basis. Faculty members review such applications to determine if the students can be accommodated to pursue their first choice or an alternate major. Students who, at entrance, will have completed 80 or fewer units from a combination of two-and four-year institutions will not be considered to have excessive units. College courses completed before high school graduation, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and Cambridge A Level examinations taken must be reported on the admission application and are recorded as transfer work. For entering freshmen, these units do not count against the maximum you are allowed to earn at UC Merced. UC Merced does not grant credit for CLEP exams, work experience, military basic training, vocational training, technical training, remedial subjects or personal enrichment courses. Admission Requirements For Transfer Students Students transferring to UC Merced as juniors must satisfy identified lower division major requirements and the transfer course subject pattern identified below.

Where possible within the context of existing course objectives, instructors may offer alternatives to animal use; this may not be possible, and they are not required to provide alternate assignments if students object to hands-on work with living organisms and biological materials. California Residency and Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (The information below is a brief summary. Updated information on California Residency requirements can be found via the UC Merced Office of the Registrar website at Supplemental Tuition for Nonresident Students If you have not been living in California with intent to make it your permanent home for more than one year immediately before the residence determination date for each semester in which you propose to attend the University, you must pay non-resident supplemental tuition in addition to all other fees. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California campuses to open on the semester system. The rules and regulations for establishing residency for tuition purposes are defined by the University of California, Board of Regents in Standing Order 110.2, Regents Policies 3105 and 3106. Also see the UC Residence Policy and Guidelines, http://www.ucop.edu/general-counsel/_files/ed-affairs/uc-residence-policy.pdf Under these rules, adult citizens and certain classes of aliens can establish residence for tuition purposes. There are also particular rules that apply to the residence classification of minors (see below). If you are an adult student (over 18 years of age) you may establish residence for tuition purposes in California if: (1) you are a U.S. citizen, (2) you are a permanent resident or other immigrant; or (3) you are a non-immigrant who is not precluded from establishing a domicile in the U.S. To establish residence for tuition purposes, you must satisfy the following 3 conditions: You must be physically present in California for more than one year (366 days) immediately prior to the residence determination date of the term for which resident classification is requested. You must have come here with the intent to make California your home as opposed to coming to this state to go to school. It’s the burden of the student to clearly demonstrate retention of California residence during periods of absence from the state. Demonstrate through objective documentation that your physical presence was coupled with the intent to make California your permanent home. Intent is evaluated as an independent element of residence, separate from physical presence, and is demonstrated by establishing residential ties in California, and relinquishing ties to the former place of residence. You must demonstrate your intention to make California your home by severing your residential ties with your former state of residence and establishing those ties with California. Your intent will be questioned if you return to your former state of residence when the university is not in session. Documentary evidence is required and all relevant indications will be considered in determining your classification. A student who is in the state solely for educational purposes will NOT be classified as a resident for tuition purposes regardless of the length of his or her stay. The financial independence requirement will not be a factor in residence determination if you are a student who is financially dependent upon a California resident parent who meets the university’s requirements for residence for tuition purposes (one year physical presence with intent to remain in the state). Financial independence will not be a factor for residence determination if you meet one of the following criteria. You: Have natural or adoptive parent(s), upon whom you are financially dependent, who meet the requirements for California residence for purposes of tuition and fees, or Are at least 24 years of age by Dec. 31 of the calendar year of the term for which classification is requested, or Are a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, or Are a ward of the court or both parents are deceased, or Have a legal dependent other than a spouse or registered domestic partner, or Are a married student, or a registered domestic partner, or a graduate student or professional student, AND you were not claimed as an income tax deduction by any individual for the one tax year immediately preceding the term for which resident classification is requested, or Are a graduate or professional school student who was not claimed as an income tax deduction by either parent or any other individual for the tax year immediately preceding the term for which classification as a resident is requested, or Are a graduate or professional student who is employed at UC 49% or more time (or awarded the equivalent in university-administered funds, e.g., grants, stipends, fellowships) in the term for which resident classification is requested, or You reached the age of majority (18 years) in California while your parents were residents (for tuition purposes) of this state AND California resident parents leave the state to establish a residence elsewhere, AND you continue to reside in the state of California after the parents’ departure. If you are an unmarried minor (17 or under), the residence of the parent(s) with whom you live is considered to be your residence. If you have a living parent, you cannot change your residence by your own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by the relinquishment of a parent’s right of control. If you lived with neither parent, your residence is that of the parent with whom you last lived. Unless you are a minor alien present in the U.S. under the terms of a non-immigrant visa which precludes you from establishing domicile in the U.S., you may establish your own residence when both your parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. If you derive California residence from a parent, that parent must satisfy the 366-day physical presence and intent requirements. You may be entitled to resident status if you are a U.S. citizen or eligible alien and your parents are separated or divorced, the residence of the parent with whom you live with for the majority of the time will be considered your residence. For example if you live with one parent during the school year and spend summers with the other parent, the home of the parent with whom you live during the school year will be considered your residence. You may be able to derive California residence status from a California resident parent, if you move to California to live with that parent on or before your 18th birthday. If you begin residing with your California parent after your 18th birthday, you will be treated like any other adult student coming to California to establish residence You may be entitled to resident status if you are a U.S. citizen or eligible alien and both parents are deceased and no legal guardian has been appointed. If a guardian is appointed then you take on the residence of the guardian appointed to you. You may be entitled to resident status if you are a U.S. citizen or eligible alien and you are adopted by a California resident who has satisfied the physical presence and intent requirements. If you have reached the age of majority (18) and have been legally adopted by a California resident (who has satisfied the physical presence and intent requirements) you may be eligible for a resident classification under the same conditions. Parent Moves to California While Student is a Minor You may be entitled to resident status if you are a U.S. citizen or eligible alien and your parent(s) move to California, while leaving you behind. You may derive your parent’s California residence as soon as it is established. You may be entitled to resident status if you are a minor U.S. citizen or eligible alien whose parent(s) was/were a California resident(s) who left the state within one year of the residence determination date if: You remained in California after your parent(s) departed You enroll in a California public postsecondary institution within one year of the departure of your parent(s), and Once enrolled, you maintain full time continuous attendance at a post-secondary institution. Financial independence will not be required in this case. If you are a minor (under the age of 18 by the residence determination date) self-supporting and have lived in California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination, you may be eligible for classification as a resident for tuition purposes. You may be entitled to resident status if you are a U.S. citizen or eligible alien and you have lived continuously with an adult who is not your parent for at least two years prior to the residence determination date. The adult with whom you are living must have been responsible for your care and control for the entire two-year period and must have been residing in California during the one year immediately preceding the residence determination date. You may be entitled to resident status if you are a U.S. citizen or eligible alien claiming emancipation on the basis of your own efforts to establish residence within the state. For residence classification purposes, the emancipation of a minor can be established by one of the following: A copy of a signed judicial order declaring the minor’s emancipation. A copy of the minor’s driver’s license or official California Identification Card that indicates emancipation. A careful and independent evaluation by the Residence Deputy as to the minor’s emancipation status. 1. Member of the U.S. Armed Forces Stationed in California on Active Duty An undergraduate student is entitled to a resident classification for as long as the student maintains the eligibility requirements. A graduate or professional student will be eligible for a resident classification for two years, by which time he or she must fulfill the UC residence requirements in order to maintain his or her residence status. Students assigned for educational purposes to a state-supported institution of higher education are not eligible for this provision. You must provide the residence deputy on campus with a statement from your commanding officer or personnel officer stating that your assignment to active duty in California is not for educational purposes. The letter must include the dates of your assignment to the state. An undergraduate or graduate student who is a former member of the Armed Forces of the United States stationed in California who was on active duty for more than one year immediately prior to being discharged from the Armed Forces may be eligible for a resident classification for the length of time he or she lives in this state after being discharged up to the minimum time necessary to become a resident (366 days). Child or Spouse of a Member of the U.S. Armed Forces An undergraduate student who is the spouse, registered domestic partner, or dependent child of a member of the military stationed in California is entitled to a resident classification for as long as the student maintains the eligibility requirements. A graduate or professional student who is the spouse, registered domestic partner, or dependent child of a member of the military will be eligible for a resident classification for one year, by which time he or she must fulfill the UC residence regulations in order to maintain his or her resident status. Those who may qualify for an exemption from nonresident supplemental tuition*: (based on federal law - The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008): An undergraduate or graduate student who is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and whose domicile or permanent duty station is in California, or the spouse, registered domestic partner, or dependent child of such member of the Armed Forces, is entitled to an exemption from nonresident tuition. Student must be continuously enrolled at the University, notwithstanding a subsequent change in the permanent duty station to a location outside of California. 2. Unmarried Child, Spouse, or Registered Domestic Partner of a Faculty Member To the extent funds are available, if you are an unmarried dependent child under age 21, the spouse, or registered domestic partner of a member of the University faculty who is a member of the Academic Senate, you may be eligible for a waiver of nonresident supplemental tuition. Confirmation of the faculty member’s membership on the Academic Senate must be secured each semester before this waiver is granted. 3. University Employment Outside of California You may be entitled to resident classification if you are a full-time University employee, or the unmarried dependent child, spouse, or registered domestic partner of a fulltime University employee who is assigned to work outside of California (e.g., Los Alamos National Laboratory, UC Center in Washington, D.C.). A review will be conducted each term to verify continuation of the applicable status. 4. Spouse, Registered Domestic Partner or Child of a Deceased Law Enforcement or Fire Suppression and Prevention Public Employee You may be entitled to a waiver of nonresident supplemental tuition if you are the child, spouse, or registered domestic partner of a deceased public law enforcement or fire suppression employee who was a California resident at the time of his or her death and who was killed in the course of fire suppression or law enforcement duties. 5. Dependent Child of a California Resident A student who has not been an adult physically present in California for more than one year (366 days), and who is the dependent child of a California resident who has been a resident for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date, may be entitled to a waiver of the nonresident supplemental tuition until the student has lived in California for the minimum time necessary to become a resident so long as continuous attendance is maintained at an institution. 6. Native American Graduates of a Bureau of Indian Affairs high school If you are a graduate of a California high school operated by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, you may be eligible for an exemption from the nonresident fee. 7. Employee of a California Public School District Any person holding a valid credential authorizing service in the public schools of the state of California who is employed by a school district in a full-time certificate position may be eligible for a nonresident supplemental tuition waiver. 8. Student Athlete in Training at the U.S. Olympic Training Center Any amateur student athlete in training at the United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista may be eligible for a waiver of nonresident supplemental tuition until he or she has lived in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident California Assembly Bill 540 (AB540) provides that students meeting certain requirements will qualify to pay in-state fees. You may be entitled to this exemption from nonresident supplemental tuition if you attended high school in California for three (3) or more years and graduated from a California high school. Submitting the AB 540 does not mean automatic qualification. A Statement of Legal Residence must also be submitted. 10. Recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor Any undergraduate student who is a recipient of a Congressional Medal of Honor or who is the child of a recipient may be eligible. The recipient must be a California resident and the student may not be older than 27, and must have an annual income that does not exceed the national poverty level. If the medal recipient was a parent who died, the parent must have been a California resident at the time of his or her death. Students who have obtained a T or U nonimmigrant visa and otherwise would meet the requirements of Section 68130.5 (AB 540) shall be exempt from paying nonresident tuition at the University until they are eligible to establish a resident classification. 12. Dependent or Ward of State through California’s Child Welfare System (Foster Youth) A student who resides in California, under 19 years of age at time of enrollment, and who is currently a dependent or ward of the state through California’s child welfare system, or was served by California’s child welfare system and is no longer being served either due to emancipation or aging out of the system, shall be entitled to a resident classification as long as he or she remains continuously enrolled. If you are a nonresident student who is in the process of establishing a residence for tuition purposes and you return to your former home during non-instructional periods, your presence in the state will be presumed to be solely for educational purposes and only convincing evidence to the contrary will rebut this presumption. (A student who is in the state solely for educational purposes will not be classified as a resident for tuition purposes regardless of the length of stay.) If you are a student who has been classified as a resident for tuition purposes and you leave the state temporarily, your absence could result in the loss of your California residence. The burden will be on you (or your parents if you are a minor) to verify that you did nothing inconsistent with your claim of a continuing California residence during your absence. Steps that you (or your parents) should take to retain a California residence include: Continue to claim California residence and address on all records such as educational, employment, or military. Retain your California voter’s registration and absentee ballot. Maintain a California driver’s license and car registration, or change them back within the time prescribed by law. Return to California during all your breaks, vacations, holidays, etc. Continue to satisfy California tax obligations. (Note: if you are claiming California residence, you are liable for payment of income taxes on your total income from the date you establish residence in the state, including income earned in another state or country.) At least a year before you start your first semester of classes, begin the process of becoming a California resident. Establish a physical presence by living in California for 366 days prior to the first day of instruction you wish to be a resident. Establish your intent to become a California resident by changing your ties immediately from your previous residence to this state. Meet one of the financial independence requirements. Time Limitation on Providing Documentation If additional documentation is required for a residence classification but is not readily accessible, you will be allowed until the end of the applicable semester to provide it. You are liable for payment of fees when they are due. Petitioning for a change of status does not alter the fee payment deadline. If you were incorrectly classified as a resident, you are subject to a nonresident classification and must pay all unpaid nonresident supplemental tuition. If you concealed information or furnished false information and were classified incorrectly as a result, you are also subject to University discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the residency deputy. Inquiries regarding residence requirements, determination and/or recognized exceptions should be directed to the Residence Deputy, Office of the Registrar, at UC Merced (209-228-2734). To appeal a decision you have 30 days following the date of the campus decision to submit a completed Application to Appeal along with a copy on your nonresident decision by email: ; FAX: 510-987-9757, Attention: Residency Analyst or by MAIL: Residency Analyst, UC Office of the General Counsel, 1111 Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607-5200."

International applicants must certify that they have sufficient funds to cover fees, tuition and living expenses for the first year of their study at UC Merced. A Foreign Applicant Questionnaire for the purpose of verifying the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded upon acceptance into graduate study. Financial verification must be provided before visa forms can be issued. A formal notice from the Dean of the Graduate Division is the official proof of admission to graduate study at UC Merced. Successful applicants will be notified as soon as possible after the program faculty has made its recommendations to the Dean of the Graduate Division. Accepted students will be asked to submit their intention to register by April 15. Submission of the Statement of Intent to Register reserves your slot in the program. Should you choose not to accept the offer of admission, we ask that you also notify us of your decision as soon as possible so that we can offer the placement to another applicant. Students must be enrolled in 8 units each semester to retain graduate student standing. Students with teaching assistant or research appointments are required to enroll in 12 units each semester. Registration provides the necessary access to courses, facilities and faculty. Students holding non-immigrant visas must register for each semester covered by their visa. UC Merced offers the Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. New students are assigned a faculty advisor and committee that assist them in developing a curriculum to meet the requirements. Although considerable flexibility to meet individual needs exists, requirements usually include a core of required material that a student must master. The M.S. and M.A. degrees are either Plan I or Plan II programs. Plan I requires a minimum of 20 semester units of upper division and graduate courses plus completion of a thesis. Plan II requires at least 24 semester units of upper division and graduate courses, followed by a comprehensive examination administered by the faculty. Students pursuing M.S. or M.A. Plan I degrees will begin their thesis research at the end of the first year. Although they may continue to take additional graduate seminars or independent study, the majority of the second year involves thesis research and writing.

General Requirements for Graduate Degrees Most requirements for graduate degree programs are determined by the Graduate Group that offers the degree. However, the Graduate Council, on behalf of the Academic Senate, has approval authority over all graduate programs on the Merced campus. Graduate students must complete a minimum of 4 units of letter-graded coursework, either upper division or graduate-level, at some point prior to receiving a graduate degree at UC Merced. If admitted for a second graduate degree, student will be held to all the usual degree requirements and University regulations pertaining to fees, examinations for advancement to candidacy, residency, etc. Courses already applied to any previously earned graduate degree cannot be applied toward the requirements of the second degree. In accordance with the policy approved by the Graduate Council, the Graduate Dean has delegated the authority to admit students for a second Master’s degree to the Graduate Groups. While official policy is to discourage duplication of degrees, graduate groups may allow more than one degree at the same level, including more than one academic or professional master’s. Admissions for a second Ph.D. is rarely granted and must be handled as an exception to policy and approved by the Graduate Dean. All requests must be made in writing to the Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Ph.D., as well as a statement assuring the Dean that the applicant’s first Ph.D. is an unrelated area and that there will be no duplication or waiving of coursework. Transfer of credit toward Master’s degree requirements are governed by the University regulation and policy summarized in the Graduate Policies and Procedures Handbook. Courses taken toward a graduate degree at another institution cannot be transferred for credit toward a Ph.D. at UCM. However a course requirement may be waived if a similar course was taken at another institution."

The academic year is divided into two semesters, and summer sessions during the summer term. Quarter units earned previously at another institution are converted to semester units by dividing the quarter units earned for each course by 1.5; for example, 4 quarter units equals 2.667 semester units. UC Merced Summer Session is committed to working with the campus community to offer a strong core of high-demand and innovative programs, courses, and learning opportunities for both matriculated and visiting students during the summer. Summer Session seeks to increase student access to high-demand courses, help students make appropriate degree progress by either catching up or accelerating their individual curriculum. Each summer, a wide variety of lower-division and upper-division courses are offered in two six-week sessions and one eight-week session to enhance the university experience offered to students. Summer Session enrollment is open to UC Merced students, visiting students, eligible high school students, and the general public. Please see the for more information including the application form for non-UC Merced students. Admission to Summer Session does not constitute admission as a regular student to the university. UC Merced students enroll directly in Summer Session courses and do not need to apply. UC Merced students in dismissed status must submit an application online and are encouraged to speak with their School advisor if they seek to be reinstated in a future term. UC Merced continuing students wishing to take courses in excess of 12 units in the summer must have the approval of the appropriate authority in their School. Information regarding Summer Session fees and the application form is available online at UC Merced students register each semester using the online registration system, MyRegistration (accessible via the MyUCMerced portal at ). The registration process includes enrolling in classes, paying fees and other financial obligations, filing a current address with the Office of the Registrar, and completing and filing other information forms. MyRegistration allows the student to enroll in classes via the Internet. With UC Merced’s Internet registration, students will always receive the most up-to-date information regarding their registration and class enrollment. Pre-assigned appointments that are spread throughout the registration period regulate access to the registration system. For security purposes, students are assigned a unique login user code and password/PIN that must be entered to access MyRegistration. Students may make changes to their course schedule through the adjustment period. Courses may be added online through the first week of instruction and may be dropped online through the third week of instruction. A new or reinstated student must also: Obtain a student ID card (“CatCard”), and If required, complete the online Statement of Legal Residence form on the Office of the Registrar’s website ( ) under the California Residency and Fees section. Access to registration (via MyRegistration) is by priority groups. The groups are established according to student class level as determined by the number of units completed, with the seniors registering first, juniors second, etc. The number of semester units a student has completed determines undergraduate classification: Students who have not registered prior to the first day of instruction are considered late enrollments. Students may be assessed a $50 late enrollment fee. Contact the Registrar’s office at the Students First Center if you wish to enroll in classes after the semester begins. During the first week of instruction, students may add a course or courses if space is available. During the second and third weeks of instruction, a student may add courses only with the permission of the instructor. After the third week of instruction, students may add a course only with the permission of both the instructor and the dean of the School with which the student is affiliated. A fee will be assessed for adding a course after the third week. First week: Students may add if space available Second and third weeks: Students may add only with instructor’s approval After third week: Students may add through petition only (see below); fee assessed During the first three weeks of instruction, students may drop a course or courses without paying a fee and without further approval. After the third week of instruction and until the end of the tenth week of instruction, a student may withdraw from a course for emergency reasons or for good cause with the signed approval of the instructor of record and confirmed by the dean of the School with which the student is affiliated, provided: The student is not on special probation (i.e. students who have successfully appealed disqualification), Dropping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student (in the judgment of the instructor and dean) and The student is not being investigated for academic dishonesty in that course. Withdrawing from a course between the 4th and 10th weeks will be approved only provided the student submits a withdrawal form including a written description of the special circumstances warranting this action; therefore, students should continue to attend the course until their withdraw request is approved. Any request to withdraw beginning in the eleventh week of instruction will only be considered under exceptional circumstances (illness or injury substantiated by a doctor’s note, recent death in the immediate family or other circumstances of equal gravity), and will only be considered following both signed approval of the instructor of record and submission of a petition that is approved by the dean of the School with which the student is affiliated. All withdrawals must be received by the Office of the Registrar by the deadlines specified. For students withdrawing after the third week of instruction, a fee will be assessed and a “W” notation will be assigned by the Office of the Registrar and appear in place of a grade on the student’s permanent transcript. Courses in which a “W” has been entered on a student’s record carry no grade points, are not calculated in the grade point average, and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the student’s progress to degree. Nevertheless, it is a marker used to indicate that the student was enrolled in the class beyond the fourth week of instruction. It does not indicate whether the student was passing or failing. With the consent of the instructor, registered students and interested individuals are permitted to audit classes. Arrangements are made directly with the faculty member under any rules the faculty member may establish, and those auditing ordinarily do not participate in exams or written papers. Priority for course resources such as classroom space and laboratory supplies is given to students who are fully enrolled in the course. Audited classes are not recorded on the student’s class schedule or on academic transcript. A petition process exists for students who seek an exception to stated academic policies, procedures, and regulations. Approval for petitions will be granted by a University committee only in cases where extenuating circumstances are evident and can be substantiated. See registrar.ucmerced.edu/policies/petitionacademicpolicy Students may petition the appropriate dean to substitute a suitable course in place of a required course. Petition forms are available at the appropriate School sites: School of Engineering, School of Natural Sciences, School of Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts. An undergraduate student may repeat only those courses in which a grade of D+, D, D-, F, U, or Not Passed was received. Undergraduate courses in which a grade of D+, D, D-, or F has been earned may not be repeated on a passed/not passed basis. Similarly, a graduate course in which a grade below a B, or a grade of U, was received may be repeated only once (and may not be repeated on a S/U basis). Repetition of a course more than once requires approval by the appropriate dean in all instances. Degree credit for a course will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. Only the most recently earned grade and grade points shall be used in computing the student grade point average for the first 16 University of California units that undergraduate students repeat. For graduate students, only the most recently earned grades will be used in computing the student grade point average for the first 8 units of repeated course work. In the case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all grades assigned and total units attempted. Certification of Full-Time Status: Undergraduate students must carry a study load of at least 15 units each semester in order to maintain normal progress toward their degree. At least 12 units are required for undergraduates to be certified as full-time students for financial aid purposes and to meet minimum progress requirements. Graduate students must carry a study load of at least 8 units each semester in order to be certified as full-time students. A graduate student must be enrolled in 12 units to qualify for university employment or to receive a university fellowship. Part-Time Student Status: If, for reasons of occupation, family responsibility, health or graduating senior status (one semester only), a student is unable to attend the university on a full-time basis, he/she may qualify for enrollment in part-time status. The student must file for part-time status each semester. To be considered eligible during the specific semester, undergraduate students must be registered for 10 units or fewer by the 10th day of instruction and graduate students must be registered in 6 units or fewer by the end of the second week of instruction. Minimum progress requirements are waived for approved part-time students. Undergraduate request for part-time status forms are available on the Office of the Registrar’s website at , and for graduate students at the Graduate Studies website at . Students approved for enrollment on a part-time basis pay the same student services fee and campus based fees as full-time students, but pay only one-half of the tuition. Part-time Nonresidents pay one-half of the Nonresident Supplemental Tuition. Undergraduates file their part-time request with the Office of the Registrar; graduate students file their request with the Graduate Studies Division. The Educational Leave Program allows students to suspend academic work at UC Merced, leave the campus and later resume studies at UC Merced with a minimum of procedural difficulties. Any registered student on the UC Merced campus, undergraduate or graduate, is eligible to enroll in the Educational Leave Program, although restrictions may be imposed on the number of times a student can participate in the program. International students are not eligible. The maximum Educational Leave is one full academic year. Applications should be filed no later than the tenth day of instruction, although exceptions can be made for medical or emergency reasons. For information regarding how the leave status will affect financial aid eligibility, please see the A $40 application fee must be paid prior to the student’s enrollment in the program. Approved applications submitted after the first day of instruction will entitle the student to only a partial refund of fees paid, in accordance with the Schedule of Refunds. The Schedule of Refunds refers to calendar days beginning with the first day of instruction. The effective date for determining a refund of fees is the date the completed and approved form is returned to the Office of the Registrar. While students may receive academic credit at other institutions and transfer this credit to UC Merced (subject to rules concerning transfer credit and School approval), participants are reminded that the intent of the program is to “suspend academic work.” Therefore, students should consult with their academic advisors and carefully evaluate the desirability of taking academic work while away from the campus during leave. Students enrolled in program are not eligible to enroll in concurrent courses at the UC Merced campus or to earn academic credit at UC Merced during the leave. Reinstatement for Educational Leaves initiated prior to the first day of the semester are guaranteed. For students who seek a leave after the tenth day of the semester, reinstatement conditions are determined as part of the leave approval. Students also must satisfy any holds that may have been placed on their registration, and pay registration fees by the established deadlines for the semester specified for return on the approved application. Students who do not return by the specified semester will be automatically withdrawn from the University. Students will not be eligible to receive normal university services during the leave. Certain limited services, however, such as career services and advising are available. Students on leave are not eligible to apply for on-campus or off-campus jobs except during the summer prior to their return for the fall semester. Students on leave may elect to purchase the Student Health Insurance Plan for one term, but are not eligible to use the Student Health Center. UCM Library borrowing privileges may be retained by purchasing a library card. International Opportunities Programs (IOP) Leave If you are planning to study abroad with a non-UC program, you may take an IOP Leave. This leave option is specifically designed to enable students to participate in a program external to UC while still maintaining their student status. You may request approval for this leave at the International Center in Room KL 101. The leave may allow financial aid to transfer, includes pre-approval of transfer credit and retains your UC Merced email address. The Senior Residence Requirement may be waived if you study abroad through the Education Abroad Program. However if you study abroad with an external program you must comply with the senior Residency Requirement that states that 24 of your last 36 units must be completed on the UC Merced campus. Your last two semesters before graduation cannot be spent studying on a non-UC program. UC Merced undergraduate degree programs are designed to be completed in eight semesters or four academic years. To meet the normal progress requirement, undergraduate students are expected to enroll in and pass an average of 15 units per semester, completing the 120 units necessary for graduation in four years. An extension of enrollment beyond nine semesters requires the approval of the student’s School. The decision on the choice of a major is a very important one and should be made on the basis of a student’s interests and abilities as well as his or her career goals. Students should look carefully into the programs available by using this catalog and visiting Schools in which they are interested. Students are encouraged to declare a major as soon as possible and should begin thinking about possible majors in their first year at UC Merced. Some major requirements demand a full four years to complete. Since students are expected to declare into a major by the time they have completed 60 units, the lower division major requirements should be planned into the student’s program for the first two years. In order to declare or change a major/concentration/minor a student must fill out a Change of Major or Change of Minor request and have it approved by the dean or other authorized person in the School to which he/she is declaring or transferring and submit it to the Students First Center. This form is available on the Office of the Registrar’s website at . Current students are only permitted to change their major/concentration/minor until the end of the third week of the semester and throughout the summer. Admission into a program may be denied or deferred if the student is in academic difficulty or has a grade point average (GPA) of less than 2.0 in courses required for the selected major. Except under unusual circumstances, no change of major/concentration/minor will be permitted after a student has attained senior standing (90 units). It is not possible to change or declare a major/concentration/minor after the student has declared their candidacy with the Office of the Registrar. NOTE: Certain schools and majors have criteria a student must meet in order to qualify for that major, more stringent than academic standing and a minimum of 2.0 grade point average (GPA). A student in good academic standing who wishes to declare more than one major must petition the undergraduate School(s) responsible for the majors and receive School Dean’s (Deans’) approval. A School Dean may deny the petition for the additional major(s) if it is determined by the School(s) that there is too much overlap in the proposed coursework to justify allowing the student to receive the additional major(s). No more than 12 upper-division units (excluding units required for School and university-level general education) may be used to satisfy requirements for all majors simultaneously, whether these units are explicitly required by the majors or count as electives toward the majors. Students must satisfy all requirements for each major, including general education requirements across Schools, if applicable. Coursework for the majors must be completed in 165 semester units or 11 semesters, whichever is greater, from the onset of college work, including AP and transfer credit. Majors earned will be noted on the student’s transcript and diploma. If the majors lead to different degrees (B.A. and B.S.), that fact will be noted on the transcript and the two-degree designations will appear on the diploma. A student who has declared multiple majors may choose to graduate with fewer majors, but if so may not continue at the University to complete any remaining major(s). In order to declare or change a minor, a student must fill out a Change of Major/Minor request and have it approved by the dean or other authorized person in the School to which he/she is declaring and submit it to the Students First Center. Except under unusual circumstances, no change of minor or declaration of minor will be permitted after a student has attained senior standing (90 units). It is not possible to change or declare a minor after the student has declared their candidacy with the Office of the Registrar. Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) The goal of the University of California’s Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) program is to educate California’s future leaders by preparing promising students for advanced education in science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM). The program is designed to identify upper division undergraduate students with the potential to succeed in these disciplines, but who have experienced situations or conditions that have adversely impacted their advancement in their field of study. Participants receive benefits such as research funding and summer room and board. Once chosen as UC LEADS Scholars, students embark upon a two year program of scientific research and graduate school preparation guided by individual faculty mentors. Scholars are provided with an excellent opportunity to explore their discipline, experience a research environment, and improve their opportunities for future study in their chosen field. The Scholar gains valuable educational experience, the University a better prepared and more diverse graduate applicant pool, and the State, well-educated future leaders. Each Scholar is mentored by a member of UC the faculty, who assists the student in designing a plan of research and enrichment activities fitted to the individual interests and academic goals of the Scholar. This “Action Plan” includes: participation in the University-wide UC LEADS Symposium attendance at professional or scientific society meetings academic enrichment activities, including preparation for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) For further information, contact the Graduate Division. McNair Scholars are ambitious students from underrepresented groups in the professoriate, who aspire to earn a Ph.D. in any academic discipline. Participants receive summer research funding, as well as access to faculty mentoring, networking opportunities, workshops and field trips, and various other activities that help them to build the confidence that they will need to succeed in graduate school and beyond. This program is open to students of junior standing and higher. The aim of this program is to diversify the professoriate. This program honors the memory of Dr. Ronald McNair, who lost his life in the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion after overcoming the hardships of life in a segregated, impoverished community, and then reaching the heights of a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Maryland. For further information, contact the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education. The University of California Washington Center (UCDC) UCDC is an academic program created in 1997 for the purpose of providing students the opportunity to continue their studies while interning in Washington, D.C. Moreover, the availability of a credit-based research seminar that satisfies upper-division course requirements for a number of majors affords students the opportunity to reflect on their intern experiences in an academic exercise. UCDC is also a residential program with apartments at the centrally-located UC Washington Center. Not only does this facilitate relocating temporarily in the nation’s capital, the Center offers students a rich exposure to the Washington community through tours and an evening speaker series. For further information, contact Professor Nathan Monroe. The UCCS Academic Program gives undergraduate and graduate students a rare opportunity to learn about California’s public policy and journalistic processes firsthand. The program includes rigorous coursework as well as professional experiences while living, interning and conducting research in the State Capitol. Offered during academic semesters and summer, students enroll in classes while working 24-40 hours per week in internship placements. The UC Center at Sacramento nurtures the ongoing dialogue between the UC and Capitol Communities, promoting excellence in public policy through academics, research and public service. For further information, please visit The ICV Program allows qualified undergraduate students at UCM to take advantage of educational opportunities at other UC campuses. This program allows students who are currently in good standing, have completed at least one year in residence on their home campus and have maintained a grade point average of at least 2.0 for work completed, and obtained approval from the Dean of their school to take courses that are not available at their home campus, participate in special programs, or study with a distinguished faculty member at another campus for one term. Students who meet the above requirements should complete an application available at the Students First Center (or see Note: The host campus pays the visiting student’s financial aid. If you are a financial aid recipient, you must have a copy of your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) sent to the home campus. Use your Student Aid Report (SAR) to make this change. UC undergraduate students may enroll, without formal admission and without payment of additional University fees, in courses at another UC campus on a space available basis at the discretion of the appropriate campus authorities on both campuses. Students qualify for this program when they have completed a minimum of 12 units as a matriculated student at the home campus (this requirement can be waived at the discretion of the dean of the appropriate School); are enrolled at both campuses in the current term with a minimum of 12 units as a matriculated student at the home campus; are in good academic standing; and are certified by their home campus as to eligibility, residence, fee, financial aid and health status. To participate in this program, please contact the Students First Center to obtain the application that must be filled out by appropriate authorities on both campuses and to ensure that the application of a non-home UC course will or will not satisfy degree, graduation, major, General Education or other specific requirements (other than unit credit). Failure to ensure the applicability of the non-home UC course to UC Merced requirements could result in a refusal to allow the course to satisfy any specific requirements (other than unit requirements). Intercampus Exchange Program for Graduate Students A graduate student registered on the UC Merced campus may become an intercampus exchange student for a full term at any of the other UC campuses with the approval of the graduate advisor, the director of the graduate group and the deans of Graduate Studies on both the home and host campuses. To be eligible, the graduate student must have attended UC Merced for a minimum of one semester before participating in the intercampus exchange program. Students are limited to a maximum of two consecutive semester based terms or three quarter-based terms on intercampus exchange. Permission for exchange is done on a semester-by-semester basis. Application forms may be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies and should be submitted four weeks in advance of the semester in which you wish to participate. Intercampus exchange students register at both campuses and pay fees on their home campus; however, they have access to student services available on the host campus. Students should make arrangements with the Office of the Registrar to follow the enrollment procedure of the host campus so that the grades students obtain in courses taken on the host campus will be transferred to records on their home campus. Grades from courses completed on the host campus will be transferred to the home campus and become part of the student’s official graduate transcript. Exchange students are considered graduate students in residence on the home campus and are not formally admitted to the host graduate school and department. For further information, contact Graduate Studies and the Office of the Registrar. UC Merced and Merced College Intersegmental Cross-Enrollment Program UC Merced and Merced College have created an Intersegmental Cross-Enrollment agreement that allows approved full-time undergraduate students from either institution to cross-enroll in one course per term (fall or spring). For eligibility requirements and approval guidelines, please see information available on the Office of the Registrar website at registrar.ucmerced.edu/services/special-programs Concurrent Credit from Another Institution With the exception of currently registered students participating in the UC/CSU/Community College Intersegmental Cross-Enrollment Program or the UC Merced and Merced College Intersegmental Cross-Enrollment Program, a student may not obtain transfer credit for courses at a non-University of California campus in a term during which the student is registered as a full-time student at UC Merced. An exception can be obtained only by petitioning the appropriate School dean well in advance of the desired registration, and the student must still be enrolled in at least 12 units at UC Merced during the term in which the exception applies. The number of midterm examinations varies at the discretion of the instructor. In undergraduate courses for which a midterm examination is required, each student has the right to take the midterm (or submit the take-home examination as required by the instructor) during one of the regularly scheduled class meetings. Dates and times for mid-terms scheduled outside of regularly scheduled class meeting times must be listed in the Schedule of Classes prior to registration. If an out-of-class exam is not listed in the Schedule of Classes, the scheduling of a midterm examination at a time other than a regularly scheduled class meeting requires mutual consent of the instructor and each student registered in the course. A student who does not consent in writing to the different time must be permitted to take the examination (or submit the take home examination) at the officially scheduled time. A student who consents in writing to the change of examination time waives the right to take the midterm at the officially scheduled time. The Schedule of Classes lists the times that final examinations are to be held. This information is available online or in the Schedule of Classes each semester so that students can avoid final examination conflicts. A student who has multiple exams on the same day may discuss the situation with the instructors of the course. An instructor has the option to agree to provide the student the exam on a different day, but is not required to do so. Final exams are scheduled according to the day-and-hour periods in which the classes are given during the semester. Once instruction begins, if a change to the time of a scheduled final exam is necessary, all students in the class must agree to the schedule change in writing. Schools offering multiple sections of the same courses may elect to schedule a common exam. Check with your instructor to determine if your class is scheduled for one of the common examination times. Students with documented disabilities may be entitled to in-class accommodations. The student must provide the instructor with a letter from the Disability Services Office recommending those academic accommodations that the instructor is responsible for providing. Students must request accommodation as soon as possible to allow the university reasonable time to evaluate the request and offer necessary adjustments. No accommodations shall alter the nature of the academic demands made of the student nor decrease the standards and types of academic performance, nor require facilities or personnel that cannot reasonably be provided. The instructor should consult with the student and the Disability Services Center with any questions or concerns. UC Merced seeks to accommodate any student who, in observance of a religious creed, encounters an unavoidable conflict with an examination schedule. In order to request accommodation, the student is responsible for providing, in writing and at the beginning of the semester, notification of a potential conflict to the individual responsible for administering the examination. Instructors will consider such requests on a case-by-case basis and determine whether such conflicts can be resolved without imposing on the instructor or the other students in the class an undue hardship that cannot be reasonably avoided. If so, the instructor will determine, in consultation with the student, a time during which the student can take the examination without incurring a penalty or violation of the student’s religious creed. Students currently registered in any regular semester and in good academic standing who by reason of advance preparation believe themselves to be adequately grounded in the materials and principles of a given course may request credit by examination for any course offered at UC Merced without formally enrolling in that course. Students may obtain a form and a copy of the prescribed conditions from the Office of the Registrar’s website at The request is subject to the approval of the instructor giving the examination and the dean of the School involved. Once the request has the signed approvals of the appropriate dean, it should be submitted to the Students First Center, accompanied by the mandatory fee. Owing to special features of the instruction, such as extensive laboratory work, certain courses may not be considered appropriate for obtaining credit by examination. In addition, credit by examination will not be approved in the following circumstances: for a student who has had prior instruction in the topic, for courses in subjects in which the student has completed more advanced work, for elementary and intermediate courses in a student’s native language or for granting credit for a course which the student has attended and audited. To earn credit through the credit by examination process, the examination must be given by a UC Merced instructor and be for a course listed in the current Catalog. The final results will be reported to the Office of the Registrar, who will record the appropriate grade (P/NP). Since failure to pass the examination will be recorded as an NP, students are encouraged to prepare fully for such an examination before attempting it. The work of all students on the UC Merced campus is reported in terms of the following grades: (passed at a minimum level of C- or better by an undergraduate student) (satisfactory - passed at a minimum level of B or better by a graduate student) (no report, when an instructor fails to report a grade for a student) A course in which the grade A, B, C, D, P or S is received is counted toward undergraduate degree requirements. A course in which the grade F, NP or U is received is not counted toward degree requirements. Grades of I or IP are not counted until they are replaced by grades A, B, C, D, P or S. Course minimum grade requirements may differ depending on the program. Students should check with their academic advisor to confirm. Grade points are assigned as follows: A+ = 4.0, A =4.0, A-= 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0, C- =1.7, D+ = 1.3, D = 1.0, D-= 0.7, F = 0.0. The grades P, S, NP, U, I and IP carry no grade points and the units in courses so graded are excluded in determination of the grade point average. A student’s grade point average is computed on courses undertaken in the University of California, with the exception of courses undertaken in University Extension. Grades A, B, C, D and F are used in determining the grade point average; grades I, IP, P, S, NP and U carry no grade points and are excluded from all grade point computations. Grade point average is calculated by dividing the accumulated number of grade points earned by the accumulated number of units undertaken. All grades except Incomplete and In Progress are considered final when assigned by an instructor at the end of a term. An instructor may request a change of grade when a computational or procedural error has occurred in the original assignment of a grade, but a grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation of a student’s work. No final grade may be revised as a result of re-examination or the submission of additional work after the close of the semester. Grade changes for “clerical” errors (such as incorrect addition of points), upon documentation, are automatically granted. Requests to interchange P, NP, S or U grades with normal letter grades based upon student need (such as to allow graduation or to meet entrance requirements for professional school) do not involve clerical or procedural errors and are automatically denied. Thus, students should exercise the Passed/Not Passed or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading options with caution. Students are reminded of their responsibility to be aware of the procedures and regulations contained in this catalog and the Schedule of Classes, to verify their class schedule and to familiarize themselves with the expectations of their instructors. No changes, except completion of an I grade as noted above, can be made to the student’s record once he or she has graduated. The grade of I may be assigned when the instructor determines that a student’s work is of passing quality and represents a significant portion of the requirements for a final grade, but is incomplete for a good cause (good cause may include current illness, serious personal problems, an accident, a recent death in the immediate family, a large and necessary increase in working hours or other situations of equal gravity). It is the student’s responsibility to obtain written permission from the instructor to receive an I grade as opposed to a non-passing grade. An Incomplete form is available from the Office of the Registrar’s website and must be filed prior to the end of the final examination period. If, however, extenuating circumstances exist where submission of the I grade form is not possible before the end of the final examination period, an instructor may submit an I grade; however, the form, including student and instructor signatures, must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the first day of instruction of the next semester (which would include the summer sessions). If the form is not received by the Office of the Registrar before the first day of instruction of the next semester, then the I grade will revert to an F, NP, or U. If an I grade is assigned, students may receive unit credit and grade points by satisfactorily completing the coursework as specified by the instructor. Students cannot re-enroll in the course to complete an I grade. Doing so would result in the course being recorded twice on the transcript. I grades are not counted in computing the grade point average. An I grade received in the fall term must be replaced by the first day of instruction in the following fall term. An I grade received in the spring or summer terms must be replaced by the first day of instruction in the following spring term. Except as noted below, any I grade that has not been replaced within the deadlines will revert to an F, NP, or U. The grade will retroactively be counted in computing a student’s grade point average. Filing a Graduation Application with an outstanding Incomplete grade on your record or with outstanding transfer work may prevent degree conferral, and you will be required to re-file for a later term. Exception: If a degree is conferred before the end of the deadlines above following the assignment of an I grade, the grade will not be converted to an F, NP, or U. However, the student still has the option of removing the I grade within the deadlines above. Students with 15 or more units of I on their record may not register without permission of the appropriate dean. For a course extending over more than one semester where the evaluation of the student’s performance is deferred until the end of the final semester, provisional grades of In Progress (IP) shall be assigned in the intervening terms. The provisional grades shall be replaced by the final grade if the student completes the full sequence. The grade IP is not included in the grade point average. If the full sequence of courses is not completed, the IP will be replaced by a grade of Incomplete. Further changes in the student’s record will be subject to the rules pertaining to I grades. Unless otherwise stated in the course description, each course is letter graded with a P/NP or S/U option (unless required for your major or graduate program), not including Freshman Seminars which are always P/NP courses. Students have until the end of the second week of each semester to change the grade option on a course via MyRegistration, accessible through MyUCMerced. After the second week of each semester and up until the last day of instruction for that semester, a student may only change the grade option on a course with the approval of their School dean using the Petition of Academic Policy form at . Students in good standing who are changing a grade option for a course from a letter grade to a P/NP option must conform to the rules guiding the taking of courses on a P/NP basis (see section on Passed/Not Passed). Undergraduate students in good standing who are enrolled in at least 12 units may take certain courses on a passed/not passed (P/NP) basis. Students may enroll in one course each term on a P/NP basis (two courses if they have not elected the P/NP in the preceding term), not including Freshman Seminars which are always P/NP courses. Changes to and from the P/NP option must be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of the appropriate dean. A student may not repeat on a P/NP basis a course that was previously taken on a letter-graded basis. The grade P is assigned for a letter grade of C- or better. If the student earns a grade of D+ or below, the grade will be recorded as NP. In both cases, the student’s grade will not be computed into the grade point average. Credit for courses taken on a P/NP basis is limited to one-third of the total units taken and passed on the UC Merced campus at the time the degree is awarded. A course that is required or a prerequisite for a student’s major may be taken on a P/NP basis only upon approval of the faculty. Schools may designate some courses as passed/not passed only. Students do not have the option of taking these courses for a letter grade. The grade of S is awarded to graduate students for work in graduate courses that otherwise would receive a grade of B or better. Graduate students, under certain circumstances, may be assigned grades of S or U, but units earned in this way will not be counted in calculating the grade point average. Forms to elect S/U grading are available from the Graduate Division’s website at and must be signed by the student’s graduate advisor. Graduate students may request to take no more than one course per term on an S/U grading basis. A graduate course in which a C, D or F grade is received may not be repeated with the S/U option. In specific approved courses, instructors will assign only Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grades. Such courses count toward the maximum number of units graded S allowable toward the degree, as specified by each degree program. Mid-semester grades provide students in lower division courses with early feedback (both positive and negative) about their academic performance. Mid-semester grades provide an opportunity for students to receive positive reinforcement and motivation if they are doing well, and to identify those who are struggling. Mid-semester grades allow faculty, advisors, and services on campus to intervene with students who are in academic difficulty, while there is still time in the semester. Mid-semester grades for all lower division courses only are reported at the end of the eighth week of the semester, and all grades are submitted as letter grades for letter-graded courses (regardless of whether the student has elected to take the course as P/NP). If a course is P/NP only, all grades will be submitted as P/ NP. Mid-semester grades are notational grades which are used to help ensure the academic success of UC Merced students in lower division courses. These grades are not recorded in any permanent record or on a student’s academic transcript. All mid-semester grades of D+, D, D- or F on any course requires freshmen-only students to attend a one-hour Academic Success Workshop. Attendance is mandatory and a hold for future semester course registration will be placed for non-participation in the one-hour workshop. Sophomores with a D+, D, D- or F grade are encouraged to attend an Academic Success Workshop, however, they can have the hold for future semester course registration released by meeting with their academic advisor. After grades are recorded for a semester or summer session, they are available online via MyStudentRecord (accessible via MyUCMerced). With the availability of online grade reporting, students can print their grade reports from the Internet. Undergraduate students will be eligible for the Dean’s Honor List if they have earned in any one semester a minimum of 12 graded units with a 3.5 grade point average or better with no grade of I or NP. Dean’s Honors are listed on student transcripts. Any student who has been found to violate the academic integrity policies during an academic year will not be eligible for the Dean’s Honor List during that academic year. Undergraduate students who are placed on the Dean’s Honor List for both semesters in a single academic year (fall and spring) will be placed on the Chancellor’s Honor List for that academic year. Probation, Dismissal, and Minimum Progress An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation if one of the following occurs: The student’s semester grade point average is less than 2.0, or The student’s cumulative University of California grade point average is less than 2.0. Probation Status: Academic review occurs at the end of each academic semester. When a student is placed on academic probation, the university notifies the student, and the student’s official transcript states “Academic Probation” for the affected semester. While on academic probation, the student is under the supervision of his/her School or advising unit. Removal from Declared Major: A student on probation may be removed from a declared major or changed to Undeclared due to failure to meet the particular standards or fulfill specific requirements that the student’s School may impose. If the student is removed from a declared major or changed to Undeclared, the student may apply to be reinstated to a School as follows: Lower Division Students (fewer than 60 units earned at the end of the semester in which the student applies) must meet these requirements: Cumulative University of California grade point average of at least 2.0 Current semester grade point average of at least 2.0 Major grade point average of 2.0-2.5 (minimum varies by School) Completion of all lower division major courses with grades of C- or higher Upper Division Students (greater than 60 units earned at the end of the semester in which the student applies) must meet the requirements listed above for Lower Division students and must also complete 8-16 units (minimum varies by School) of upper division major requirements. Return to Good Standing: Once a student has met grade point average standards listed above, the student’s academic status returns to regular academic standing. An undergraduate student is subject to academic dismissal from the university if one of the following occurs: The student has been on academic probation for two or more semesters and the student’s cumulative grade point average is less than 2.0, or The student’s semester grade point average is less than 1.5 and the student’s cumulative grade point average is less than 2.0. Academic Dismissal Appeals: A student not previously on probation who earns a semester grade point average below 1.5 is offered the opportunity to appeal dismissal. The student who is subject to academic dismissal and does not complete the appeal process as prescribed is automatically dismissed. The student whose appeal is approved returns on probation and is under the supervision of the appropriate School or advising unit. Dismissal Status: When a student is academically dismissed, the university notifies the student, and the student’s official transcript states “Academic Dismissal” for the affected semester. Note: A student who is academically dismissed may return after fulfilling reinstatement requirements (see the Reinstatement policy on the Office of the Registrar website at An undergraduate student is subject to administrative probation if the student does not complete a minimum of 24 University of California units during an academic year, including summer. Return to Good Standing: Once the student has completed 24 units during a subsequent academic year, the student’s minimum progress status returns to good standing. Note: Minimum unit completion does not apply to part-time students or to students who have a Dean’s approval to carry fewer units than the minimum progress load (reasons may include medical disability, employment, a serious personal problem, a recent death in the immediate family, the primary responsibility for the care of a family, or a serious accident involving the student). Reinstatement is the act of restoring active-student status to former students who have withdrawn from the University, had their student matriculation interrupted by a lapse of their student status (for failure to pay fees, failure to satisfy the entry level writing requirement, failure to enroll in future semesters, or failure to graduate), or who left the University in academic difficulty (academic probation, special probation, subject to disqualification, or academically dismissed). Undergraduate students who wish to return to the University of California, Merced must file an application for reinstatement with the Office of the Registrar by the deadlines listed below. Students should begin the process of reinstatement at least six weeks before the deadline. Submitting the application, along with the nonrefundable application fee of $70.00 as early as possible will provide enough time to review the application and have a reinstated student register before new incoming students are scheduled to register for classes. Students who do not enroll in the semester to which they are reinstatedmust file a new reinstatement application and pay the application fee to return in a future semester. For more information, see registrar.ucmerced.edu/policies/reinstatement To transfer from one campus of the University to another, or from one School to another on the same campus, a student who has been academically disqualified or is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the dean to whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. Transcripts may be ordered via the National Clearing House website. See the Office of the Registrar’s website at for further information. At times other than the end of the semester, the normal period required for processing transcripts for both registered and former students is 1 to 3 business days after receipt of the student’s request. There is a $12 charge for each routine transcript request and $40 charge for each express mail transcript request. Electronic transcripts are available and are $20 per transcript. The student’s financial account must be paid in full prior to the processing of the transcript request, and the transcript fees must be paid online through the National Clearing House. Students are entitled by law and University policy to examine and challenge most of the records that the University maintains on them. These records are confidential and in most circumstances may be released to third parties only with the student’s prior consent. See information about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy act at . Transcripts and other documents submitted from other institutions and agencies are the property of UC Merced and will not be reissued to applicants, students, alumni or other parties. Students may request to change their name on official University records. The form can be downloaded from the Office of the Registrar’s website at . Legally recognized proof of the change of name will be required before the petition is accepted and processed. (Students planning to graduate should file this request no later than the fifth week of the semester in which they intend to graduate.) Students may also update their address(es) using MyStudentRecord. Students who find that they cannot attend the University for a semester in which they have enrolled may cancel their registration only if instruction for that semester has not yet begun. To do so, they must formally request a cancellation or withdrawal of their registration from the Office of the Registrar after obtaining all appropriate signatures. If instruction has already begun and students find it necessary to stop attending all classes, they must formally request withdrawal from the University. When a completed withdrawal form is approved by the dean of the School with which the student is affiliated (after the third week of instruction), a W notation will be assigned for each course in which the student has been enrolled. Students will not be eligible to re-enroll until they have been reinstated. Before considering a complete withdrawal, students must consult an academic advisor and the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, if appropriate, to consider the full implications of this action. Please see the refund policies for specific details on refund rules. Students who fail to submit the required paperwork for cancellation/withdrawal will receive F, NP or U grades, as appropriate, for all courses in which they are enrolled for that semester. Each candidate for the bachelor’s degree must complete 24 of the last 36 units in residence in the school of the University of California in which the degree is to be earned. Under certain circumstances, the appropriate dean or Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education may grant exceptions, such as when a student attends classes at another UC campus as an approved visitor or participates in one of the following: UC Education Abroad, UC Washington Center Program or UC Sacramento Center. To receive a bachelor’s degree, a candidate must have a cumulative 2.0 grade point average. Students expecting to complete work for their degree by the end of a semester must declare their intent to graduate by submitting an application, accompanied by the appropriate fee, for the semester in which they plan to receive the degree. Students have until February 15 of each year to file to graduate in the spring semester, until June 15 to file to graduate in the summer term, or until September 15 of each year to file to graduate in the fall semester. For more information, see registrar.ucmerced.edu/policies/graduation The Office of the Registrar will check all pertinent records to ensure that the student has completed a minimum of 120 units and appropriate institutional requirements. The student’s School will check for the fulfillment of major and School requirements. UC Merced students can check their degree progress at any time using MyAudit online through . MyAudit analyzes degree requirements for a major, concentration, and minor according to the catalog year when a student enters UC Merced. The audit gives a complete picture regarding what degree requirements have been met, are in progress, and are remaining. It is a quick tool that can be used to check progress in toward any degree program. Although MyAudit provides a comprehensive description of program requirements, it is unofficial and not intended to supplement the role of the School advisors, who help students with course selection and assist in making informed decisions. See To be eligible for honors at graduation, a student must have completed a minimum of 50 semester units at the University of California, of which a minimum of 43 units must have been taken for a letter grade and a minimum of 30 units must have been completed at UC Merced. The grade point average achieved must rank in the top 2 percent of the student’s School for highest honors, the next 4 percent for high honors, and the next 10 percent for honors at graduation. The number of recipients eligible under these percentages shall be rounded up to the next higher integer. Before a graduate degree can be conferred, candidates must have been advanced to candidacy and completed the master’s thesis (if required) or doctoral dissertation and any required comprehensive or oral examinations. For assistance, go to the Graduate Division office. UC Merced conducts its annual Commencement ceremony following the spring semester. Graduating students are strongly encouraged to participate with their classmates. Commencement celebrates the academic achievements of our undergraduate and graduate students and the impact they will have as they transition from the University to the world beyond. Each student may participate in only one Commencement ceremony as an undergraduate. Graduate students may participate in two ceremonies if master’s and doctoral degrees are conferred in separate years. Undergraduates may choose to participate in the Commencement ceremony if they completed their degree requirements the prior fall, or if they anticipate completing their degree requirements in spring, summer or the next fall semester. Students who complete their degree requirements in a fall semester may elect to participate in Commencement the spring prior to their completion date or they may cross the stage the following spring. Participating in Commencement does not indicate confirmation that degree requirements have been fulfilled. Diplomas are not distributed at Commencement and degrees are not awarded until all requirements are completed. Diplomas are not distributed at Commencement, but are available several months afterward. The Office of the Registrar emails students when diplomas are mailed and will retain diplomas for five years only."

(Note: Aid is not available for students on special or limited enrollment status, or students enrolled in University Extension, with the exception of students enrolled in the Teacher Preparation Program.) All students, regardless of family income, are encouraged to apply for financial aid. About 90 percent of UC Merced undergraduate students received some form of financial assistance. Financial aid is intended both to remove financial barriers for families who cannot afford the cost of a higher education, and to fill in the gap for families who can afford a portion of the cost. A number of factors, in addition to family income, are considered in determining your financial eligibility, including household size, number of family members in college, assets, and whether the student will be living on- or off-campus. Although most grant awards are based on financial need, some loans and scholarships are available regardless of need. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships has bilingual advising staff who are dedicated to helping students and their parents navigate the application process and understand the financial aid opportunities available to them at UC Merced. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships welcomes your questions and is here to provide services and guidance that will contribute to your educational experiences at UC Merced.

Students who receive financial aid may receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans and work-study. funded by federal and state governments, foundations, corporations, and/or non-profit organizations. Recipients are typically determined based on financial need, or in connection with a research proposal or project, and do not have to be repaid. The proceeds of the grants are used to help offset recipients’ cost of education and/or research expenses. The Federal Government provides funds for Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The State of California also offers Grants (A and B), Middle Class Scholarships (MCS), and Chafee Grant for Current or Former Foster Youth to qualified undergraduate students. In addition, institutional grant funds are provided by the University of California. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, applicants must be U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, be enrolled in an eligible undergraduate program, have not previously received a bachelor’s degree, and demonstrate financial need. The amount you receive depends on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as determined by completing the FAFSA, as well as your enrollment load. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) These are need-based grants provided to low-income undergraduate students to promote access to post-secondary education. Priority is given to students with exceptional financial need. To be eligible for a Cal Grant award, applicants must be California residents or meet the eligibility criteria for AB 540, demonstrate financial need and meet appropriate deadlines. The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) administers the Cal Grant program. Go to the CSAC website at awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees. Note: It does not cover campus-based fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. For first-year students, Cal Grant B provides a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. For students in their second through fourth years, it covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees, plus a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. , if you are a Cal Grant recipient, in order to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. Eligibility is determined by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) and awards are determined by the campus. MCS applies to undergraduate students who do not qualify for the UC Blue & Gold Opportunity Program. Students whose families have income and assets up to $171,000 per year may be eligible for a scholarship of up to 40% of mandatory system-wide tuition and fees. Note: Eligibility for MCS will be reduced by the amount of other need-based aid applied to cover UC System-wide tuition and Student Service Fees (e.g., Pell Grant, Cal Grant, Fee Waivers, institutional need-based aid such as Bobcat Grant, Scholarships, etc.). Awards are typically posted in early August. Eligibility is determined by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). This grant provides up to $5,000 a year for current or former foster youth. The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Application is available on the Commission’s Web site at The University of California returns a portion of all tuition revenue to financial aid programs. UC Merced uses this funding to provide a need-based institutional grant program (Bobcat Grants) to eligible students. Bobcat Grant eligibility is determined using the UC Education Financing Model (EFM) formula approved by the UC Regents for all UC campuses. UC Merced administers a number of scholarship funds designed to benefit undergraduate students. These scholarships are provided through the generosity of UC alumni, friends of UC Merced, corporations, businesses, professional associations and UC Merced. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit, academic achievement or special talents and do not have to be repaid. Some scholarships are also awarded on the basis of financial need. For new students, one application does it all! All incoming students are automatically considered for all institutional scholarships administered by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships simply by submitting a FAFSA (citizen/eligible non-citizens) or CA Dream Act Application (undocumented students) by March 2. New students must have at least a 3.25 GPA to be considered for most scholarships. External scholarship opportunities are posted on our website at ucmerced.academicworks.com/opportunities/external Continuing students must submit a FAFSA (citizens/eligible non-citizens) or CA Dream Act Application (undocumented students) AND a Continuing Student Scholarship Application by March 2 at finaidapps.ucmerced.edu. Continuing students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA as of the end of the prior fall semester to be considered for institutional scholarships. Following is a partial list of scholarships that are administered through the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office and awarded to new and continuing students through the application process explained above: * Beverlee Sieghold Antoine Endowed Scholarship * Jefferson Jennings Doolittle Scholarship * John C. “Jack” Pjerrou Endowed Scholarship * Ken and Midge Riggs Endowed Scholarship * Kris-Tangella Academic Excellence Endowed Scholarship * Merced County Association of Realtors Scholarship * Merced Mall Regional Shopping Center Scholarship * Merced School Employees Federal Credit Union (MSEFCU) Scholarship * Stephanie Rae Tomford Endowed Scholarship * Stephen D. Peterson Endowed Scholarship * Wells Fargo Scholarship for High School and Transfer Students Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment with interest. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. The State of California requires that students be told the following: Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning that the Department of Education provides the funding for this federal loan program. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school, but can defer any interest payment until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time working towards a degree. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. If the parent-borrower does not qualify for a PLUS Loan, they may either: Obtain an Endorser (i.e., another adult who is willing to co-sign the loan); or If the parent cannot locate an Endorser, the dependent student may then qualify to borrow additional Unsubsidized loan funds on their own. Undocumented students who graduate from a California high school and meet the CA Dream Act requirements are eligible for state and university aid; however, they are ineligible for federal aid including federal loans. The DREAM loan program aims to close that gap and provide eligible students with the opportunity to borrow student loans to help pay for their education. There is no interest or payments while the student is in school and for six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. Alternative loans are funds available to students who are not eligible for financial aid or they need additional funds to meet their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance minus other financial aid or the annual loan maximum amount as determined by the lender. Because Alternative Loans are not guaranteed by the federal government, they must be insured privately. This extra cost is passed on to the borrower in the form of higher fees and interest rates. In addition, the lender will look at your credit history as well as other factors to determine if they will lend to you. You may be denied by one lender and approved by another because of the different ways the lender interprets your information. [How to apply] Please Note: Students should exhaust all federal student loan eligibility before borrowing private student loans. Students who are awarded Federal Work-Study (FWS) are provided with the opportunity to work part-time (i.e., up to 18 hours per week during an academic term), typically on-campus, while earning money to help pay for their educational-related expenses. Jobs are available with flexible schedules that can be adjusted around each student’s classes. Students may only earn up to the amount they were awarded. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award on-line at: All FWS and non-FWS jobs are posted by Center for Career & Professional Advancement (CCPA) Office at Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the criteria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S.; be accepted for admission to the University; be enrolled at least half-time and in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted for financial aid purposes, with the exception of the Teacher Preparation Program); demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans); maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; be registered for the selective service if the student is a male and 18 to 25 years old, and is not currently on active duty with the armed forces; and not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Please note: Financial need is the difference between the Cost of Attendance (based on living on-campus, off-campus, or at home) and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Please note, if you are a Cal Grant recipient, in order to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. Piloted in Summer 2021, and commencing in the 2021/22 academic year, UC Merced will recalculate financial aid after the 15th day of instruction for all undergraduate and graduate recipients based on their enrollment status in those classes which we can confirm that the student began attendance. If we are unable to document the student’s attendance in a class, via CatCourse activity or instructor reporting, aid will be adjusted to exclude the units for that class. Student will have an opportunity to appeal if they have supporting documentation confirming their attendance. The Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards listed below apply to all aid applicants, whether aid was received for prior coursework. A student’s eligibility for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is affected by this policy. : In addition to the requirements listed below, all students, whether receiving aid or not, must also meet the university’s academic GPA standards established by the Registrar. Please refer to the Registrar’s website for these standards. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for financial aid eligibility, students must meet all three standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, and a maximum time-frame requirement. If a student fails to maintain SAP, he or she will be notified that he or she is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for continued financial aid will only be re-established if the student subsequently meets the SAP requirements; or if the student successfully appeals and his or her aid is reinstated. SAP Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. A student who has financial aid eligibility reinstated as the result of an appeal is placed on an approved SAP Appeal and becomes subject to the terms of that Appeal. All work performed to regain eligibility under this SAP policy must be completed at UC Merced. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) will evaluate whether the student is adhering to the plan on a term-by-term basis. If the student has made up all deficiencies, he or she will no longer be considered on Appeal and instead will be considered an eligible student meeting the SAP requirements. If the student fails to meet the terms of their Appeal, their aid will be suspended until the student can re-establish SAP on their own without aid. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Undergraduate students must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Post-Baccalaureate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Graduate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 70 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer credits UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). These pace calculations include all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e. independent study courses). Please Note: Required remedial courses will count toward the Pace requirement. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the Pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). All undergraduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following unit limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study (major) or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Full-time students are allowed up to 180 units of financial aid eligibility, including transfer units. 180 units - Transfer Units = Remaining Eligibility for Bachelor Degree Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum unit limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum unit limit. Maximum Time-frame measure also includes all of the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Every unit attempted as of the end of the Add/Drop period is counted toward the maximum time limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached the maximum unit limit. Accepted transfer units taken between (non-concurrent) enrollment at UC Merced will be added to the total number of transfer units the student has and will be used to determine remaining units of eligibility. Units taken while concurrently enrolled at UC Merced do not count as a separate year of eligibility. Students pursuing a double-major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Post-Baccalaureate (Teacher Preparation Program) Post-baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program students are eligible for financial aid for up to 62 units following completion of their baccalaureate degree (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). All post-baccalaureate financial aid applicants exceeding this unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. All graduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. are eligible for financial aid for up to 72 units following completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum unit limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum unit limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum unit limit. may be eligible for financial aid for up to 216 units following the completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Terms in which the student withdraws are counted toward a student’s maximum unit limit. Terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum unit limit. Summer terms attended are counted when determining if a student has reached his maximum unit limit. Students wishing to appeal must submit a UC Merced SAP Appeal to the UC Merced Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. All appeals must state the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances during the term(s) in question that hindered academic performance, such as prolonged hospitalization, death or extreme sickness in the family, etc. Supporting documentation of these extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships once the appeal has been submitted electronically. Furthermore, students must submit, as part of the appeal, information regarding what has changed that would prevent a recurrence and would now allow them to re-establish the satisfactory academic progress requirements by the conclusion of the outlined time-frame. In the appeal, students must detail how they will make up their deficiencies: If deficient in units, what they will do to ensure that they pass the minimum number of units the following academic year to meet the minimum unit or pace requirements by the conclusion of the plan; If deficient in GPA, the minimum GPA required for each future term to eventually meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirement by the conclusion of the plan; If maximum units of eligibility has been reached, the number of additional units required to complete degree requirements. Please Note: In all circumstances, students must report which future terms of enrollment will be required to complete any and all academic deficiencies. Academic Advisors will review and suggest academic plans for each appeal submitted. By suggesting a plan, the advisor ensures that, if followed, the plan will permit the student to meet the SAP requirements at the end of the plan’s duration. Deadline dates for each term are published annually on financial aid website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If students notified, do not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a request in writing to the Office Financial Aid and Scholarships for consideration of a late appeal. Once received by the aid office, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Appeals will be considered incomplete until documentation is received. An email is sent to the student with instructions to submit the documentation to the OFAS. Once accepted, appeals will be evaluated by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email letter that the decision is final and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. If the appeal is approved, students will be sent an email notifying them to log into their SAP Appeal to view and accept the terms and conditions of their appeal. Note: if the terms and conditions are not accepted a student’s financial aid will not disburse. Students withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: the date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or the date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who will be on a Planned Education Leave are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of his/her intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. For additional detailed information about Return to Title IV Funds at UC Merced, please see the “Return to Title IV Aid” guide available at the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. IMPORTANT WARNING: Your semesters of financial aid eligibility are limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave you use up one semester of eligibility! Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, Financial Aid proceeds are distributed to the student’s account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. This money will be applied towards institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate.

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts I would like to welcome you to the UC Merced School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA). Our School is home to many diverse disciplines, programs, students, and faculty. We offer important courses that are the background to a liberal arts education, as well as a range of basic and advanced courses in specific disciplines. Our campus opened-up in 2005, and in a relatively short time, SSHA has grown to be the largest School on campus. Across our 10 departments, we house 14 majors, 18 minors, the Merritt Writing Program, and 7 graduate programs. SSHA provides opportunities for students to explore subjects in depth, while embracing interdisciplinary study and research across the arts, humanities, social and STEM sciences. Indeed, UCM has grown faster than any other UC campus, and has achieved or exceeded the timing of many of the milestones expected for a new university. I encourage you to become a SSHA student and be part of this exciting adventure. I am a firm believer in a solid liberal arts education, no matter what your career trajectory. Having exposure to humanities, arts, and social science, will allow you to think critically and creatively. In addition, SSHA faculty have a long tradition of student-focused teaching and research opportunities. Thus, while we are a UC campus, our smaller size and philosophy towards students provides for student-faculty engagement, student research opportunities, and community connections beyond what you may find in other places. Please explore the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts through our . Let us know if you would like to visit or receive more information about our School. Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Carlston Cunningham Chair in Cognitive Development Director, UC Merced Alliance for Child and Family Health and Development Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, world languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. At Least 120 units to include the following: At least 60 semester units of upper division courses. Students must complete all course prerequisites with a C- or better. When a letter grade option is available for a major requirement, students must complete that requirement with a C‐ or better; a 2.0 GPA must be maintained in all major course work.

The meaning of UC Merced baccalaureate degrees is strongly connected to distinctive features of UC Merced: An ethos of discovery, creativity, and rigorous questioning of extant knowledge permeates all aspects of UC Merced. The skills, knowledge and attitudes of a researcher are synonymous with attributes essential for post-graduate success. Merced is at a crossroads – culturally, socioeconomically, environmentally, geographically, historically – for addressing problems of local, regional, and global significance. With An Undergraduate Student Body Unique in the UC System UC Merced undergraduates are predominantly first generation students from groups under-represented in higher education (e.g., race, ethnicity, family income). Given this unique institutional context, the Hallmarks of Baccalaureate Degrees at UC Merced 1. Depth and breadth in academic and intellectual preparation, consistent with the values of UC Merced as a small research university, such that UC Merced graduates Demonstrate a strong disciplinary foundation.

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts I would like to welcome you to the UC Merced School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA). Our School is home to many diverse disciplines, programs, students, and faculty. We offer important courses that are the background to a liberal arts education, as well as a range of basic and advanced courses in specific disciplines. Our campus opened-up in 2005, and in a relatively short time, SSHA has grown to be the largest School on campus. Across our 10 departments, we house 15 majors, 19 minors, the Merritt Writing Program, and 7 graduate programs. SSHA provides opportunities for students to explore subjects in depth, while embracing interdisciplinary study and research across the arts, humanities, social and STEM sciences. Indeed, UCM has grown faster than any other UC campus, and has achieved or exceeded the timing of many of the milestones expected for a new university. I encourage you to become a SSHA student and be part of this exciting adventure. I am a firm believer in a solid liberal arts education, no matter what your career trajectory. Having exposure to humanities, arts, and social science, will allow you to think critically and creatively. In addition, SSHA faculty have a long tradition of student-focused teaching and research opportunities. Thus, while we are a UC campus, our smaller size and philosophy towards students provides for student-faculty engagement, student research opportunities, and community connections beyond what you may find in other places. Please explore the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts through our . Let us know if you would like to visit or receive more information about our School. Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Carlston Cunningham Chair in Cognitive Development Director, UC Merced Alliance for Child and Family Health and Development Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, world languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree.

We focus on developing innovative education that provides deep engineering competence, promotes high ethical standards, and delivers solutions to our challenges in an economically, environmentally, and socially responsible manner. The School of Engineering offers the following majors: The School of Engineering offers the following minors: Management Analytics and Decision-Making Minor Engineering is about problem solving, innovation, and the creation of devices, systems, processes, and structures to benefit society. Engineers create new ideas and then transform those ideas into products and services that improve people’s lives. As part of this creative process, engineers apply mathematics and the principles of the natural sciences to solve problems and meet the needs of society. Engineering spans the very small to the very large, from micro-sensors that can continuously monitor human health, to space stations that can support the exploration of new worlds. It also touches our everyday lives. Engineering has provided our shelter, our transportation, our entertainment, our medical supplies and technologies, our water supplies, the food we eat, the movies we watch, the appliances that make our lives easier and the protection of our environment. Engineering careers are among the highest in demand in the world including the United States and, as a result, provide great personal and professional satisfaction and quality of life. Engineering is a “people-serving profession” and a pathway to financial security. In short, engineering makes the world work! Now, more than ever, we need talented and highly creative people to participate in this exciting profession. Engineering is all about creating things that never were, transforming culture, and improving human lives and conditions around the world. At one of the youngest and most diverse universities in the country, engineering education at UC Merced is both challenging and satisfying. You will meet extraordinary people: world-class faculty, committed fellow students, dedicated staff, and partners from the local community and around the world. The social network you will develop in the School of Engineering and beyond during your time at UC Merced will last a lifetime. Our goal is to help you explore ways in which engineering and appropriate technology helps people and prepare you for a career of leadership and responsibility. Congratulations on your vision and initiative. I look forward to welcoming you into the School of Engineering and watching you develop into a technical leader prepared for the complexities of tomorrow. Under the advisement of a faculty mentor, students have the opportunity to form service-learning teams that work with an approved community not-for-profit organization—or client—to develop technology-based solutions that support its success. For example, a team composed of both upper and lower division students might work together to design, develop, implement and test an information system to serve the needs of a local non-profit service organization. Students who get involved in a UC Merced Service Learning project may earn up to two units per semester for participation, depending on their leadership position within the team for that semester Each student must register in at least 12 units per semester and of these 12 units, two classes must be major prep (math/science), ENGR or major-specific, technical requirements. The major-specific courses cannot be university or campus requirements, nor can they be Social Science, Humanities and Arts (SSHA) general education courses. Each student must successfully complete — at UC Merced — no fewer than the following number of units: 15 x (N-1) = units needed. N = semesters at UC Merced. Summer sessions are not counted as semesters. Any student who fails to achieve normal progress will be subject to academic withdrawal and will need approval to continue at UC Merced. Any student can petition the School of Engineering if their failure to make normal progress is due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control.

Students holding non-immigrant visas must register for each semester covered by their visa. UC Merced offers the Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Management (M.M.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. New students are typically assigned a faculty advisor and committee that assist them in developing a curriculum to meet the requirements. In some graduate programs, students begin their first year in a rotation of faculty research groups. Although considerable flexibility to meet individual needs exists, requirements usually include a core of required material that a student must master. The Master’s degrees are either Plan I or Plan II programs. Plan I requires a minimum of 24 semester units in approved graduate courses plus completion of a thesis. Plan II requires at least 24 semester units in approved graduate courses, followed by a comprehensive examination or capstone/culminating project administered by the faculty. Students pursuing Master’s Plan I degrees will begin their thesis research at the end of the first year. Although they may continue to take additional graduate seminars or independent study, the majority of the second year involves thesis research and writing. The thesis committee must approve the scope of the thesis and provide guidance during the process of developing the thesis. Approval of the thesis must be unanimous for the awarding of the Master’s degree. The Ph.D. degree is designed to prepare students for creative activity and original research. A Doctoral degree is awarded in recognition of a student’s knowledge of a broad field of learning and for distinguished accomplishment in that field through an original contribution of significant knowledge. The dissertation must demonstrate a high level of critical ability, imagination and synthesis. In contrast to the Master’s degrees, there are no University unit requirements for the Doctorate, although individual programs may set specific course requirements. However, students must complete at least four semesters of academic residence at UC Merced and successfully complete the course requirements before they are allowed to take the Qualifying Examination. All students pursuing the Ph.D. degree must pass a Qualifying Examination before admission to candidacy. The intent of this examination is to ascertain the breadth of a student’s comprehension of fundamental facts and principles that apply in the major field of study. It will also determine the student’s ability to think critically about the theoretical and practical aspects of the field. Students are advanced to candidacy when they fulfill the following requirements: • Successfully completed the Qualifying Exam; • Maintained a minimum grade point average of 3.0; • Received incomplete grades in no more than two courses; and • Fulfilled any language requirement associated with their program. Once a student is advanced to candidacy, it is imperative that they begin their dissertation studies promptly. The goal of the Master’s degree at UC Merced is to sufficiently educate students at an advanced level in specific fields of knowledge so that they may continue in their pursuit of graduate education, or be competitive for careers in the private or public sector. Towards this end, recipients of the Master’s degree: Have an understanding of the principles that underlie the field of study. Are able to use the research and/or working methodologies of the field of study. Are able to use the communication formats of their field to effectively communicate with professional, specialist audiences as well as to other audiences as appropriate for the field.

Graduate study is administered by the Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Education and by the Graduate Council, a committee of the UC Merced Academic Senate. The Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs is a system-wide body that assures coordination between the campuses and develops general policies that govern graduate education throughout the University of California. Several forms of financial support are available to facilitate the pursuit of a graduate education at UC Merced. Most forms of support are granted for merit, while others are granted for financial need or a combination of merit and need. The Graduate Division works closely with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and the academic units to coordinate all forms of financial support. The Graduate Division and Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships administer need-based financial aid for graduate students. We are here to help students understand financial aid opportunities as well as the criteria utilized in determining eligibility for the various financial aid programs available at UC Merced. For more information on graduate student financial support, please see Financial support is available at UC Merced in the form of graduate student research positions, teaching assistantships positions, fellowships and loans. All students, regardless of income, are encouraged to apply. Graduate Student Research (GSR) Positions Graduate Student Research (GSR) positions are typically supported through external funding agencies for specific research projects. Graduate students may assist with research work in a wide variety of ways, and some projects may provide opportunities for advanced students to lead certain efforts, with guidance and oversight of the principal investigator. GSRs are especially valuable for graduate students pursuing research careers. Teaching Assistants help provide instruction in courses with relatively larger numbers of enrolled students. Assistance takes a variety of forms, which include leading lab and discussion sections, helping to prepare instructional materials, and grading of exams and papers. TAships also provide valuable training for graduate students as future faculty members at all institutions of higher education. A limited number of teaching assistantships are available each year. On the recommendation of the academic deans, the academic units make appointments to teaching assistantships. Fellowships are awarded primarily on the basis of merit and the promise of outstanding academic and professional achievement. Consideration is given to the extent and quality of previous undergraduate and graduate work, evidence of ability in research or other creative accomplishment, evidence of intellectual capacity and promise of productive scholarship. Financial need or the availability of other sources of support in your graduate program is not relevant to the evaluation of academic merit, but may be an additional criterion for some fellowships. Students must establish eligibility for need-based fellowships by filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). For faster and more accurate filing, students can complete the FAFSA online at Financial aid awards that require repayment, loans, offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. Some loan programs are based on financial need, but there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest loans. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans - Not based on financial need, these loans are available to all eligible students, regardless of income. This loan is “unsubsidized” in that the student is responsible for paying all interest due. There is no federal interest subsidy for the loan. Interest accrues immediately upon disbursement. Borrowers may elect to pay accrued interest on a monthly or quarterly basis or have it added back to the principal balance in a process called capitalization. PLUS Loans for Graduate and Professional Degree Students – Graduate and professional degree students are eligible to borrow under the PLUS Loan Program up to their cost of attendance minus other estimated financial assistance. The terms and conditions applicable to Parent PLUS Loans also apply to Graduate/Professional PLUS loans. These requirements include a determination that the applicant does not have an adverse credit history, repayment beginning on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Applicants for these loans are required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). They also must have applied for their annual loan maximum eligibility under the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program before applying for a Graduate/Professional PLUS loan. section under Financial Aid and Scholarships for more information on the academic requirements for student loans. General Requirements for Graduate Degrees Most requirements for graduate degree programs are determined by the Graduate Group that offers the degree. Students must satisfy the degree requirements outlined in the Graduate Group Policies and Procedures that are in effect at the time they are admitted to a graduate program. If the degree requirements are subsequently revised, the Graduate Group may, where appropriate, give students the option to meet the new requirements. A student who withdraws from a program or loses student status for other reasons for more than two semesters, will be bound by the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission unless otherwise stipulated and agreed to in writing by the Graduate Group and approved by the Graduate Dean. A student who defers admission or who changes to another program must meet the requirements in effect at the time of first registration. The University of California, in general, discourages the duplication of advanced degrees. At the same time, it recognizes that a professional degree does not duplicate an academic degree, and that the holders of either an academic or professional degree may have the pressing need to earn another degree in an area different from that of their existing graduate degree(s). The Graduate Dean has delegated the authority to admit students for a second Master’s degree to the Graduate Groups. Admission for a second or concurrent Ph.D. is rarely granted, and must be handled as an exception to policy and approved by the Graduate Dean. All requests must be made in writing to the Graduate Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second or concurrent Ph.D., as well as a statement assuring the Dean that the applicant’s first Ph.D. is in an unrelated area and that there will be no duplication, transfer, or waiving of coursework. Transfer of credit toward Master’s degree requirements are governed by the University regulation and policy summarized in the UC Merced Graduate Policies and Procedures Handbook. Courses taken toward a graduate degree at another institution cannot be transferred for credit toward a Ph.D. at UC Merced. However, a course requirement may be waived if a similar course was taken at another institution and the instructor and Graduate Group Chair determine that the student exhibits adequate knowledge and understanding of the relevant material. The General Petition form should be used for all requests for waivers of course work. To obtain a waiver, the Graduate Group should submit a full description of the course including a syllabus and a copy of the student’s transcripts along with the Petition to the Graduate Division for review and approval."

Learn more here: admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/exam-requirement/ HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR GRADE-POINT AVERAGE The grade-point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before 12th grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four-point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before 12th grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during 12th grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level courses. Honors courses are Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and designated Standard Level courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school’s course list. Courses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade. No more than two units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 can be assigned extra points. D grades are not assigned extra points. Students who receive D or F grades in “a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or a more advanced level in the same subject. The omission of a yearlong course in Geometry cannot be validated by a more advanced level math course. For more information about meeting and validating the Geometry requirement, please see page 20 in the Quick Reference Guide to UC Admissions at admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/_files/documents/quick-reference.pdf . Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International Freshman Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international freshman applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade-point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 6.5. For more information visit All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors can be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as freshmen: Academic grade point average in all completed A-G courses, including additional points for completed UC-certified honors courses. Number of, content of and performance in academic courses beyond the minimum A-G requirements. Number of and performance in UC-approved honors, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and transferable college courses. Identification by UC as being ranked in the top 9 percent of your high school class at the end of your junior year (Eligible in the Local Context, or ELC). Quality of your senior-year program as measured by the type and number of academic courses in progress or planned. Quality of your academic performance relative to the educational opportunities available in your high school. Outstanding performance in one or more specific subject areas. Outstanding work in one or more special projects in any academic field of study. Recent, marked improvement in academic performance, as demonstrated by academic GPA and the quality of coursework completed or in progress. Special talents, achievements and awards in a particular field, such as visual and performing arts, communication or athletic endeavors; special skills, such as demonstrated written and oral proficiency in other languages; special interests, such as intensive study and exploration of other cultures; experiences that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, such as significant community service or significant participation in student government; or other significant experiences or achievements that demonstrate the student’s promise for contributing to the intellectual vitality of a campus. Completion of special projects undertaken in the context of your high school curriculum or in conjunction with special school events, projects or programs. Academic accomplishments in light of your life experiences and special circumstances, including but not limited to: disabilities, low family income, first generation to attend college, need to work, disadvantaged social or educational environment, difficult personal and family situations or circumstances, refugee status or veteran status. Location of your secondary school and residence. If you enrolled in a regular session of college- or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a freshman. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges who have completed at least 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units). While preparing to transfer at the junior level, you must complete a pattern of courses that will prepare you for further study in your chosen major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available at admissions.ucmerced.edu/transfer/major-preparation-schools If you are enrolled at a California Community College, you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower-division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman- and sophomore-level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition, you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the Transfer Credit Practices Section of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found at Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter-grade basis will be computed into the grade-point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of AR, EW, W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your GPA. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. If you have attended only community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit, and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university can have up to 79 transferable semester (118 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer without a dean’s review. Applicants with 80 semester (120 quarter) units or more; a dean’s review is required. Transfer Credit Policy for University of California, Merced, Effective Fall 2018 The University of California, Merced, grants unit credit for college courses completed at United States regionally accredited colleges and universities; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Courses determined to be essentially the same as courses offered for an undergraduate degree at any UC campus will be granted credit, if the course: Is listed in the original institution’s catalog/website of official courses offered for the year in which the course was completed, and Includes the same or similar content, and Requires the same or similar prerequisite course work, and Is offered at the same level of instruction. Courses that further the student’s knowledge and understanding in fundamental liberal arts disciplines such as mathematics, natural science, literature, social sciences, fine arts and philosophy are acceptable for transfer if comparable in scope and depth to those offered at the UC. Courses accepted for transfer must be reported on an official transcript (academic record), which must be provided to UC Merced in a sealed envelope from the original college/university of enrollment, bearing the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. UC does not award credit posted to a third-party institution’s transcript. Credit is only considered from the original institution’s official academic record. work or volunteer experience, vocational or technical training, and personal enrichment courses; remedial academic or pre-baccalaureate courses, especially in English and mathematics; or College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) exams. Courses completed at unaccredited/non-regionally accredited institutions may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. UC Merced can award lower-division (freshman/sophomore level) units for military courses completed if the courses are consistent with the University policy on granting transfer credit when there is an equivalent course taught at a UC campus. UC Merced will consult the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations for information regarding course content as a guide to the awarding of credit. Courses from enrollment at another UC main campus (not UC Extension) during a regular academic (fall, winter, spring) or summer term are all transferable. Courses from enrollment at any UC Extension division are transferable if the course is numbered X1- X199; courses numbered 1-199 which include a campus designation (e.g. XB, XLA) are equivalent to the same course offered to undergraduates on that campus. Students will be granted up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any other institution or any combination of other institutions. For units beyond the maximum allowed, subject credit for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation will be granted and can be used to satisfy requirements. Units earned through AP, IB and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. Units earned at any UC campus (Extension, summer, cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. Note: if all courses are completed at one or more 2-year (community) colleges, a student would never be in danger of having too many (excessive) units. In addition, there is a limit to the number of units for which UC Merced grants credit in the following areas: English as a Second Language courses: Maximum 8 semester/12 quarter units Physical Education activity courses: Maximum 4 semester/6 quarter units. A maximum of 8 semester/12 quarter units of PE Theory UC Merced will not grant credit for college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously completed course, or examination for which credit has already been granted, with the exception of the repeat of deficient (C-/D/F) course grades. UC Merced grants credit for examinations as follows: International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level GCE or Hong Kong Advanced Level (A-Levels) – unit credit could be granted for satisfactory grades and scores. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST) exams. Every California Community College has an agreement with the UC – a Transfer Course Agreement (TCA). The TCA specifies which courses receive UC credit. To learn if college courses from a California Community College are transferable to UC Merced, visit . These lists are updated throughout the year, so check ASSIST periodically to ensure you have the most current information. Other two-year and four-year Institutions: The UC does not have transfer course agreements with institutions other than the California Community Colleges. However, using ASSIST and/or referring to any UC campus’ general catalog can provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer to UC Merced. UC Merced does not grant credit for junior/community college programs that are technical or vocational, or programs that do not lead to further academic study at a university in the international country. Elementary/intermediate language courses: No credit is granted to students who were instructed in that language during secondary school. Final determination on the transferability of coursework for credit will be made by UC Merced’s Office of Admissions, based on UC Merced’s review (not that of another institution). ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Students transferring to UC Merced as juniors must satisfy identified lower division major requirements and the transfer course subject pattern identified below.

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts I would like to welcome you to the UC Merced School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA). Our School is home to many diverse disciplines, programs, students, and faculty. We offer important courses that are the background to a liberal arts education, as well as a range of basic and advanced courses in specific disciplines. Our campus opened-up in 2005, and in a relatively short time, SSHA has grown to be the largest School on campus. Across our 10 departments, we house 15 majors, 19 minors, the Merritt Writing Program, and 7 graduate programs. SSHA provides opportunities for students to explore subjects in depth, while embracing interdisciplinary study and research across the arts, humanities, social and STEM sciences. Indeed, UCM has grown faster than any other UC campus, and has achieved or exceeded the timing of many of the milestones expected for a new university. I encourage you to become a SSHA student and be part of this exciting adventure. I am a firm believer in a solid liberal arts education, no matter what your career trajectory. Having exposure to humanities, arts, and social science, will allow you to think critically and creatively. In addition, SSHA faculty have a long tradition of student-focused teaching and research opportunities. Thus, while we are a UC campus, our smaller size and philosophy towards students provides for student-faculty engagement, student research opportunities, and community connections beyond what you may find in other places. Please explore the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts through our . Let us know if you would like to visit or receive more information about our School. Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Carlston Cunningham Chair in Cognitive Development Director, UC Merced Alliance for Child and Family Health and Development Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, world languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. At Least 120 units to include the following: Students must complete all course prerequisites with a C- or better. When a letter grade option is available for a major requirement, students must complete that requirement with a C‐ or better; a 2.0 GPA must be maintained in all major course work. Students must complete all major requirements with a C- or better and maintain a 2.0 GPA in all major course work. Courses graded with a pass/no pass grading option are limited to one third of the total number of units required for general education. Students must obtain pre-approval through the SSHA Advising Office for all courses completed at institutions other than UC Merced. ” section on the UC Merced General Education page. Transfer students are strongly encouraged to complete IGETC in order to prepare for work within the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts. Students who do not complete IGETC before transferring are required to complete SSHA Foundations, an IGETC-like general education pattern. Please see the approved Transfer Selection Criteria under each major in the UC Merced General Catalog for required coursework, and review the Transfer Admission Requirements at the following website: admissions.ucmerced.edu/transfer/requirements To ensure proper placement in our world languages courses, students with previous academic instruction in the language that they would like to study are encouraged to take the placement exam for that language. However, students wishing to use language proficiency to satisfy a major, minor or general education requirement must have their placement scores confirmed by the world languages program. Please contact the World Languages Program Coordinator or a UC Merced academic advisor for more information. Note: Students may not complete placement exams after they have enrolled in a UC Merced course in that language. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Programs The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts is pleased to offer a number of interdisciplinary programs outside of the majors. Students are encouraged to take courses within the following areas of study:"

We focus on developing innovative education that provides deep engineering competence, promotes high ethical standards, and delivers solutions to our challenges in an economically, environmentally, and socially responsible manner. The School of Engineering offers the following majors: The School of Engineering offers the following minors: Management Analytics and Decision-Making Minor Engineering is about problem solving, innovation, and the creation of devices, systems, processes, and structures to benefit society. Engineers create new ideas and then transform those ideas into products and services that improve people’s lives. As part of this creative process, engineers apply mathematics and the principles of the natural sciences to solve problems and meet the needs of society. Engineering spans the very small to the very large, from micro-sensors that can continuously monitor human health, to space stations that can support the exploration of new worlds. It also touches our everyday lives. Engineering has provided our shelter, our transportation, our entertainment, our medical supplies and technologies, our water supplies, the food we eat, the movies we watch, the appliances that make our lives easier and the protection of our environment. Engineering careers are among the highest in demand in the world including the United States and, as a result, provide great personal and professional satisfaction and quality of life. Engineering is a “people-serving profession” and a pathway to financial security. In short, engineering makes the world work! We need talented and highly creative people to participate in this exciting profession to address the needs and welfare of society. Engineering is all about creating things that never were, transforming culture, and improving human lives and conditions around the world. At one of the youngest and most diverse universities in the country, engineering education at UC Merced is both challenging and satisfying. You will have an opportunity to learn and grow in a diverse and student focused environment. You will meet extraordinary people: world-class faculty, committed fellow students, dedicated staff, and partners from the local community and around the world. The social network you will develop in the School of Engineering and beyond during your time at UC Merced will last a lifetime. Our goal is to help you explore ways in which engineering and appropriate technology helps people and prepare you for a career of leadership and responsibility. I look forward to welcoming you into the School of Engineering and watching you develop into a technical leader prepared for the complexities of tomorrow. Each student must register in at least 12 units per semester and of these 12 units, two classes must be major prep (math/science), ENGR or major-specific, technical requirements. The major-specific courses cannot be university or campus requirements, nor can they be Social Science, Humanities and Arts (SSHA) general education courses. Each student must successfully complete — at UC Merced — no fewer than the following number of units: 15 x (N-1) = units needed. N = semesters at UC Merced. Summer sessions are not counted as semesters. Any student who fails to achieve normal progress will be subject to academic withdrawal and will need approval to continue at UC Merced. Any student can petition the School of Engineering if their failure to make normal progress is due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control."

Pell Grant maximum awards for full-time students may change from year to year depending on Congressional appropriations. The award amount depends on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as determined by completing the FAFSA, as well as your enrollment load (i.e., full-time, ¾-time, ½-time, less than ½-time). Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) The SEOG program is a federal campus‐based program designed to supplement other sources of financial aid for undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional financial need based on FAFSA data. As a federal campus‐based program, annual SEOG allocations are provided to individual universities in varying amounts, based on the school’s enrollment data, and may be awarded to students at the school’s discretion within the parameters of federal student aid eligibility guidelines. Therefore, SEOG fund availability, award amounts, and eligibility requirements vary from university to university. Due to our limited allocation, we award this grant to our neediest students first until funds are exhausted. The Cal Grant Program is a state-funded grant program administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) to assist California resident and AB540 students who meet the eligibility criteria, demonstrate financial need, and meet appropriate application deadlines, in paying for their education to attend a California college or university. These awards do not need to be repaid by the student. Cal Grant awards may be renewed for up to three additional years if the recipient continues to meet the income, asset, unmet need, enrollment level, academic progress, and the aid application priority filing deadline parameters as outlined by CSAC. Recipients of these awards may also apply for a fifth year of funding while enrolled in eligible teaching credential programs. More information about Cal Grants can be found on CSAC’s website. awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees. Note: It does not cover campus-based fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. For first-year students, Cal Grant B provides a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. For students in their second through fourth years, it covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees, plus a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. Please note if you are a Cal Grant recipient, to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. Initial eligibility is determined by the CSAC and award amounts are determined by the campus. MCS applies to undergraduate students who do not qualify for the UC Blue & Gold Opportunity Program. For 2022-23, students whose families have income and assets up to $191,000 per year may be eligible for a scholarship of up to 35% of mandatory system-wide tuition and fees. Note: Eligibility for MCS will be reduced by the amount of other need-based aid applied to cover UC System-wide tuition and Student Service Fees (e.g., Pell Grant, Cal Grant, Fee Waivers, institutional need-based aid such as Bobcat Grant, Scholarships, etc.). Awards are typically posted in early August. CSAC administers the Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program through an interagency agreement with the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program provides eligible California youth aging out of the foster care with financial assistance to attend an eligible postsecondary institution. Students may be eligible to receive up to $5,000 per year. The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Application is available on CSAC’s website. The University of California returns a portion of all tuition revenue to financial aid programs. UC Merced uses this funding to provide a need-based institutional grant program (Bobcat Grants) to eligible students. Bobcat Grant eligibility is determined using the UC Education Financing Model (EFM) formula approved by the UC Regents for all UC campuses. UC Merced administers various scholarships designed to assist undergraduate students with their educational costs. These scholarships are provided through the generosity of UC alumni, Friends of UC Merced, corporations, businesses, professional associations, and UC Merced. These scholarships include: Merit-Based/Academic Scholarships (i.e., outstanding academic performance, talents, and leadership ability. May include intended area of interest); and, Need-Based Scholarships (i.e., demonstrated financial need from the FAFSA or CADAA. May include academic performance). For new students, one application does it all! All incoming students are automatically considered for institutional scholarships administered by the OFAS simply by submitting a FAFSA (citizen/eligible non-citizens) or CA Dream Act Application (undocumented students) by March 2. New students must have at least a 3.25 GPA to be considered for most scholarships. If the student has been awarded a scholarship by an external entity, they are obligated to report it to us via their UC Merced Connect portal so we can add it to their financial aid award package. Additional external scholarship opportunities are posted on our website at ucmerced.academicworks.com/opportunities/external Continuing students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA as of the end of the prior fall semester to be considered for institutional scholarships. Continuing students must submit a FAFSA or CADAA AND a Continuing Student Scholarship Application online by March 2nd. Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment with interest. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning the loans are processed through the U.S. Department of Education and are funded by the U.S. Treasury. This ensures that the borrower will have a reliable and predictable source of funding. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. Payments and interest begin six months after the student either graduates or drops below half-time enrollment. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school, but may opt to defer any interest payments until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. If interest is deferred, it will be capitalized (i.e., added to the loan balance) when repayment begins. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. If the parent-borrower does not qualify for a PLUS Loan, they may either: Obtain an Endorser (i.e., another adult with good credit who is willing to co-sign the loan); or If the parent cannot locate an Endorser, the dependent student may then qualify to borrow additional Unsubsidized loan funds on their own. Undocumented students who graduate from a California high school and meet the CA Dream Act requirements are eligible for state and university aid; however, they are ineligible for federal aid including federal loans. The CA DREAM loan program helps close that gap by providing eligible students with the opportunity to borrow student loans to help pay for their education. There is no interest while the student is enrolled at least half-time working toward a degree. Payments and interest begin six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. The State of California requires that students be informed of the following: Federal student loans are available to students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Alternative loans are funds available to students who are not eligible for financial aid, or they need additional funds to meet their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance minus other financial aid or the annual loan maximum amount as determined by the lender. Because alternative loans are not guaranteed by the federal government, they must be insured privately. This extra cost is passed on to the borrower in the form of higher fees and interest rates. In addition, the lender will look at your credit history as well as other factors to determine if they will lend to you. You may be denied by one lender and approved by another because of the different ways the lender interprets your information. [How to apply] Students should exhaust all federal student loan eligibility before borrowing private student loans. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program is a federal campus-based program designed to provide eligible students an opportunity to work part-time (i.e., up to 18 hours per week during an academic term), typically on-campus, while earning money to help pay for their educational-related expenses. Jobs are available with flexible schedules that can be adjusted around each student’s classes. Students may only earn up to the amount they are awarded for the year. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award online at UC Merced Connect. All FWS and non-FWS jobs are posted online at UC Merced’s Handshake page. Financial aid programs are subject to myriad federal, state, UC, and institutional regulations that students must meet to qualify and maintain their aid eligibility. These requirements generally include: Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S. and complete the FAFSA, OR live in California and meet the requirements for non-resident exemption AB540 status and complete the CA Dream Act Application (CADAA); Be accepted for admission to the University. Be enrolled at least half-time and in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted for financial aid purposes, except for the Teacher Preparation Program). Demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans). Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for financial aid, as outlined below. Not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Please note: Financial need is the difference between the Cost of Attendance (based on living on-campus, off-campus, or at home) and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student, and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Please note, if you are a Cal Grant recipient, to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. Piloted in Summer 2021, and commencing in the 2021/22 academic year, UC Merced will recalculate financial aid after the 15th day of instruction for all undergraduate and graduate aid recipients based on their enrollment status in those classes which we can confirm that the student began attendance. If we are unable to document the student’s attendance in a class, via the learning management system (i.e., CatCourses) activity or instructor reporting, aid will be adjusted to exclude the units for that class. Student will have an opportunity to appeal if they have supporting documentation confirming their attendance. The Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards listed below apply to all aid applicants, whether aid was received for prior coursework. A student’s eligibility for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is affected by this policy. : In addition to the requirements listed below, all students, whether receiving aid or not, must also meet the university’s academic GPA standards established by the Registrar. Please refer to the Registrar’s website for these standards. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, students must meet all three standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, and a maximum timeframe. If a student fails to meet any standard, they will be notified that they are ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for financial aid will only be reinstated if the student subsequently meets the SAP requirements or if the student successfully appeals. SAP Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Undergraduate students must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Post-Baccalaureate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. Graduate students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 70 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). The pace calculation includes all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e., independent study courses). Required remedial courses are included in the Pace calculation. Undergraduate students are eligible for financial aid for up to 180 units - Transfer units = Remaining eligibility for bachelor’s degree Students exceeding the maximum timeframe will be ineligible to receive financial aid. Students will not be granted additional eligibility solely by reason of changing their major or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Every unit attempted as of the end of the Add/Drop period is counted toward the maximum timeframe. Units earned during terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum timeframe.[LH1] Maximum timeframe measure also includes all the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section.[LH2] Units earned during summer terms attended are counted toward the maximum timeframe. All transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Students pursuing a double-major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Post-Baccalaureate (Teacher Preparation Program) Teacher Preparation Program students are eligible to receive financial aid for up to following completion of their baccalaureate degree (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). All post-baccalaureate financial aid applicants exceeding this unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. All graduate financial aid applicants exceeding the following unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. are eligible to receive financial aid for up to following completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Every unit attempted as of the end of the Add/Drop period is counted toward the maximum timeframe. Units earned during terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum timeframe Units earned during summer terms attended are counted toward the maximum timeframe. are eligible to receive financial aid for up to following the completion of their baccalaureate degrees (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). Every unit attempted as of the end of the Add/Drop period is counted toward the maximum timeframe. Units earned during terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum timeframe Units earned during summer terms attended are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Students wishing to appeal must submit a SAP Appeal to the OFAS by the posted deadline. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. The SAP Appeal deadline is published annually on the OFAS website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If a student does not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a written request to the OFAS to be considered to submit a late appeal. All appeals must include a statement that explains the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances that hindered academic performance during the term(s) in question, such as death of an immediate family member, major medical issue, etc. Appeals must also include a plan that explains the strategies they will use to meet the SAP requirements by the conclusion of the outlined time-frame. Supporting documentation of the extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the OFAS once the appeal statement and plan for improvement have been submitted electronically. The documentation should be date-specific and from a disinterested third party. Appeals submitted without supporting documentation will not be reviewed. Once received by the OFAS, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Appeals are considered incomplete until documentation is received. Once accepted, appeals are evaluated by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee within three to four weeks. Academic Advisors will create academic plans for all appeal submissions when the student has a cumulative GPA of 1.0 or less or 90+ completed units. The plan ensures that, if followed, the student will maintain sufficient progress toward their degree. Academic plans become part of the Terms and Conditions a student must follow if their appeal is approved. If the appeal is approved, the student will be informed via email notifying them to review and accept Terms and Conditions. Financial aid will not disburse until the Terms and Conditions are accepted. Financial aid eligibility is reinstated for one term at a time within the academic year, until the OFAS evaluates SAP for all students at the end of spring. The OFAS monitors adherence to Terms and Conditions at the end of every term and only extends financial aid eligibility to the following term if the Terms and Conditions from the term prior are met. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email that the decision is final, and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. More information about the SAP Appeal Process can be found on the OFAS website. Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, financial aid funds are disbursed into the student’s university account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. All funds are applied to institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate. Students withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: The date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or The date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who enroll in the Educational Leave Program are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of their intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. More information about Withdrawing can be found on the OFAS website. IMPORTANT WARNING: The duration of your financial aid eligibility is limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave for a term after aid is disbursed you use up one semester of eligibility! For many students, college is the first time they are in control of their own finances. In 2020, we launched UC Merced’s Financial Wellness Center (FWC). The Center provides education and empowerment on money management topics relevant to college life and beyond. This is accomplished through the delivery of digital content, interactive workshops, classroom engagement, special campus events, and personalized financial coaching sessions, as well as working closely with the Basic Needs Office and the Dean of Students. Coaching topics include Personal Budgeting, Bank Accounts, Moving Off-Campus, Paychecks, Insurance, Salary Negotiation, Credit Scores, Homebuying, Investing, Student Loan Repayment, Car Buying, Leases, ID Theft, Retirement, Emergency Savings, Financial Crisis."

We do not require SAL Subject Tests, and you can use subject tests to satisfy the A-G requirements listed above. Learn more here: admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/exam-requirement/ HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR GRADE-POINT AVERAGE The grade-point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before 12th grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four-point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before 12th grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during 12th grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level courses. Honors courses are Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and designated Standard Level courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school’s course list. Courses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade. No more than two units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 can be assigned extra points. D grades are not assigned extra points. Students who receive D or F grades in “a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or a more advanced level in the same subject. Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International Freshman Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international freshman applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade-point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 6.5. For more information visit Qualifying for Admission Review by Examination Alone You might be able to qualify for admission to the University by examination alone through achieving high scores on the ACT Plus Writing, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay and two SAT Subject Tests (excluding Mathematics Level 1). To be considered for admission to the University by examination alone, you must achieve a minimum UC Score Total of 410 (425 for nonresidents). In addition, you must earn a minimum UC Score of 63 on each component of the ACT, SAT Reasoning Test, or SAT with Essay and on each SAT Subject Test. You cannot use a SAT Subject Test to meet these requirements if you have completed a transferable college course in that subject with a grade of C or better. For more information, visit universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/freshman/requirements/examination/ All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors can be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as freshmen: Academic GPA in all required “a-g” courses, including additional points for completion of University-certified honors courses. SAT/ACT scores and SAT Subject Tests are not required but can be considered if submitted. Number, content of and performance in academic courses beyond the minimum “a-g” requirements. Number of and performance in University-approved honors courses, and Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and transferable college courses. Identification as being ranked in the top 9 percent of your high school class at the end of your junior year (“eligible in the local context”).

Quality of your academic performance relative to the educational opportunities available in your secondary school. Outstanding performance in one or more academic subject areas. Outstanding work in one or more special projects in any academic field of study. Recent, marked improvement in academic performance, as demonstrated by your academic GPA and the quality of coursework completed or in progress. Special talents, achievements and awards in a particular field, such as visual and performing arts, communication or athletic endeavors; special skills, such as demonstrated written and oral proficiency in other languages; special interests, such as intensive study and exploration of other cultures; experiences that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, such as significant community service or significant participation in student government; or other significant experiences or achievements that demonstrate your promise for contributing to the intellectual vitality of the campus. Completion of special projects undertaken either in the context of your high school curriculum or in conjunction with special school events, projects or programs. Academic accomplishments in light of your life experiences and special circumstances. If you enrolled in a regular session of college- or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a freshman. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges who have completed at least 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units). While preparing to transfer at the junior level, you must complete a pattern of courses that will prepare you for further study in your chosen major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available at admissions.ucmerced.edu/major-preparation If you are enrolled at a California Community College, you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower-division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman- and sophomore-level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition, you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the Transfer Credit Practices Section of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found at Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter-grade basis will be computed into the grade-point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your GPA. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. If you have attended only community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit, and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university can have up to 79 transferable semester (118 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer without a dean’s review. Applicants with 80 semester (120 quarter) units or more; a dean’s review is required. Transfer Credit Policy for University of California, Merced, Effective Fall 2014 The University of California, Merced, grants unit credit for college courses completed at United States regionally accredited colleges and universities; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Courses determined to be essentially the same as courses offered for an undergraduate degree at any UC campus will be granted credit, if the course: Is listed in the original institution’s catalog/website of official courses offered for the year in which the course was completed, and Includes the same or similar content, and Requires the same or similar prerequisite course work, and Is offered at the same level of instruction. Courses that further the student’s knowledge and understanding in fundamental liberal arts disciplines such as mathematics, natural science, literature, social sciences, fine arts and philosophy are acceptable for transfer if comparable in scope and depth to those offered at the UC. Courses accepted for transfer must be reported on an official transcript (academic record), which must be provided to UC Merced in a sealed envelope from the original college/university of enrollment, bearing the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. UC Merced can award lower-division (freshman/sophomore level) units for military courses completed if the courses are consistent with the University policy on granting transfer credit when there is an equivalent course taught at a UC campus. UC Merced will consult the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations for information regarding course content as a guide to the awarding of credit. work experience, military/recruit basic training, vocational or technical training, or remedial academic or personal enrichment courses. Remedial academic courses in English and mathematics are not transferable. Courses completed at unaccredited/nonregionally accredited institution could be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Courses from enrollment at another UC main campus (not UC Extension) during a regular academic (fall, winter or spring) or summer term are all transferable. Courses from enrollment at any UC Extension are transferable if the course is numbered 1-199; courses numbered 1-99 that include a campus designation (e.g. XB, XSB) are equivalent to the same course offered to undergraduates on that campus. UC Merced grants credit for examinations as follows: International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level GCE or Hong Kong Advanced Level (A-Levels) – unit credit could be granted for satisfactory grades and scores. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST) exams. Students will be granted up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any other institution or any combination of other institutions. For units beyond the maximum allowed, subject credit for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation will be granted and can be used to satisfy requirements. Units earned through AP, IB and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. Units earned at any UC campus (Extension, summer, cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. In addition, there is a limit to the number of units for which UC Merced grants credit in the following areas: English as a Second Language courses: Maximum 8 semester/12 quarter units Physical Education activity courses: Maximum 4 semester/6 quarter units UC Merced will not grant credit for college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously completed course, or examination for which credit has already been granted, with the exception of the repeat of deficient (D/F) course grades. Every California Community College has an agreement with the UC – a Transfer Course Agreement (TCA). The TCA specifies which courses receive UC credit. To learn if college courses from a California Community College are transferable to UC Merced, visit . These lists are updated throughout the year, so check ASSIST periodically to ensure you have the most current information. Other two-year and four-year Institutions: The UC does not have transfer course agreements with institutions other than the California Community Colleges. However, using ASSIST and/or referring to any UC campus’ general catalog can provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer to UC Merced. UC Merced does not grant credit for junior/community college programs that are technical or vocational, or programs that do not lead to further academic study at a university in the international country. Elementary/intermediate language courses: No credit is granted to students who were instructed in that language during secondary school. Final determination on the transferability of coursework for credit will be made by UC Merced’s Office of Admissions, based on UC Merced’s review (not that of another institution).

Interim Vice Provost and Dean of the Graduate Division Admission to a graduate program at UC Merced requires a bachelor’s degree, or its equivalent, that is comparable to a degree from the University of California both in the level of scholarly achievement and in the distribution of academic subject matter. Although applications for graduate study will be evaluated primarily on scholarly achievement, UC Merced will utilize the totality of a prospective student’s qualifications, including research, work experience, recommendations and other creative accomplishments, to render a decision. To be eligible for graduate admission at UC Merced, you must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average in your undergraduate coursework. In addition to a formal graduate admission application and official transcripts, applicants must submit official Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, and three letters of recommendation. Certain Graduate Groups may require a sample of your written work that can be evaluated by the admissions committee. Applications to UC Merced can be accessed electronically at . Applications are accepted for the fall semester only. Prospective students are encouraged to begin the admissions process as early as possible in the prior academic year. International applicants should check the Graduate Division website for details regarding application and admission. Please check our website for application and priority funding due dates. In order for an application to be fully considered, a nonrefundable application fee must be paid. You may pay with a credit card. Fee exemptions for UC approved programs are , provides further information about admission requirements, financial assistance, deadlines and important contacts. Students with credentials from universities outside the United States should begin the application process well in advance of the deadline date. Official copies or certified copies of all transcripts in English and in the original language are required. Applicants whose primary language is not English are required to demonstrate proficiency in English for admission consideration. Any applicant who spent the majority of their primary and secondary education in a nation/territory where English is not the primary language must take an approved English proficiency examination prior to admission. Proficiency in English may be demonstrated by passing one of two standardized, internationally administered tests: TOEFL (the Test of English as a Foreign Language) or IELTS (International English Language Testing System). Please note that TOEFL and IELTS scores expire two years after the test date. The applicant should take one of these tests at the earliest available date to ensure that the scores are reported in time to meet application deadlines. Applicants will not be admitted if they lack an acceptable proficiency score. Passing scores are defined on our website. Information on the TOEFL is available online at . These requirements are waived for applicants who have received an advanced degree from a U.S. institution or from a country where English is the language of instruction. International applicants must certify that they have sufficient funds to cover fees, tuition and living expenses for the first year of their study at UC Merced. Financial verification must be provided before visa forms can be issued. A formal notice from the Dean of the Graduate Division is the official proof of admission to graduate study at UC Merced. Successful applicants will be notified as soon as possible after the program faculty have made their recommendations to the Dean of the Graduate Division. Accepted students will be asked to submit their intention to register by April 15. Submission of the Statement of Intent to Register reserves your slot in the program. Should you choose not to accept the offer of admission, we ask that you also notify us of your decision as soon as possible so that we can offer the placement to another applicant. Students must be enrolled in 8 units each semester to retain graduate student standing. Students with teaching assistant or research appointments are required to enroll in 12 units each semester. Registration provides the necessary access to courses, facilities and faculty. Students holding non-immigrant visas must register for each semester covered by their visa. UC Merced offers the Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Management (M.M.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. New students are assigned a faculty advisor and committee that assist them in developing a curriculum to meet the requirements. Although considerable flexibility to meet individual needs exists, requirements usually include a core of required material that a student must master. The Master’s degrees are either Plan I or Plan II programs. Plan I requires a minimum of 24 semester units in approved graduate courses plus completion of a thesis. Plan II requires at least 24 semester units in approved graduate courses, followed by a comprehensive examination administered by the faculty. Students pursuing Master’s Plan I degrees will begin their thesis research at the end of the first year. Although they may continue to take additional graduate seminars or independent study, the majority of the second year involves thesis research and writing. The thesis committee must approve the scope of the thesis and provide guidance during the process of developing the thesis. Approval of the thesis must be unanimous for the awarding of the Master’s degree. The Ph.D. degree is designed to prepare students for creative activity and original research. A Doctoral degree is awarded in recognition of a student’s knowledge of a broad field of learning and for distinguished accomplishment in that field through an original contribution of significant knowledge. The dissertation must demonstrate a high level of critical ability, imagination and synthesis. In contrast to the Master’s degrees, there are no University unit requirements for the Doctorate, although individual programs may set specific course requirements. However, students must complete at least four semesters of academic residence at UC Merced and successfully complete the course requirements before they are allowed to take the Qualifying Examination. All students pursuing the Ph.D. degree must pass a Qualifying Examination before admission to candidacy. The intent of this examination is to ascertain the breadth of a student’s comprehension of fundamental facts and principles that apply in the major field of study. It will also determine the student’s ability to think critically about the theoretical and practical aspects of the field. Students are advanced to candidacy when they fulfill the following requirements: • Successfully completed the Qualifying Exam; • Maintained a minimum grade point average of 3.0; • Received incomplete grades in no more than two courses; and • Fulfilled any language requirement associated with their program. Once a student is advanced to candidacy, it is imperative that he/she begin his/her dissertation studies promptly. The goal of the Master’s degree at UC Merced is to sufficiently educate students at an advanced level in specific fields of knowledge so that they may continue in their pursuit of graduate education, or be competitive for careers in the private or public sector. Towards this end, recipients of the Master’s degree: Have an understanding of the principles that underlie the field of study. Are able to use the research and/or working methodologies of the field of study. Are able to use the communication formats of their field to effectively communicate with professional, specialist audiences as well as to other audiences as appropriate for the field. Are proficient in the professional skills necessary to lead productive careers in their chosen profession. Degree specific versions of these objectives are available under each program’s description. The goal of the Ph.D. degree at UC Merced is to advance human knowledge and to provide for the dissemination and use of that new knowledge. We will educate students at the most advanced level in specific fields of knowledge so that they may assume positions of leadership in research, teaching, industry, business and government. Toward this end, recipients of the Ph.D.: Are able to apply the underlying fundamental principles and philosophies of their field in the production of new knowledge. Are able to use the research methodologies of the field of study. Are able to use the communication formats of their field to effectively communicate with professional, specialist audiences as well as to other audiences as appropriate for the field. Are self-directed learners able to advance their field of study. Are proficient in the professional skills necessary to lead productive careers in their chosen profession. Are versed in the topic of research integrity and apply in their work the ethical norms of behavior associated with their field of study. Degree specific versions of these objectives are available under each program’s description. Graduate study is administered by the Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Education and by the Graduate Council, a committee of the Academic Senate. The Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs is a system-wide body that assures coordination between the campuses and develops general policies that govern graduate education throughout the University of California. Several forms of financial support are available to facilitate the pursuit of a graduate education at UC Merced. Most forms of support are granted for merit, while others are granted for financial need or a combination of merit and need. The Graduate Division works closely with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and the academic units to coordinate all forms of financial support. The Graduate Division and Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships administer need-based financial aid for graduate students. We are here to help students understand financial aid opportunities as well as the criteria utilized in determining eligibility for the various financial aid programs available at UC Merced. For more information on graduate student financial support, please see Financial support is available at UC Merced in the form of graduate student research positions, teaching assistantships, fellowships and loans. All students, regardless of income, are encouraged to apply. Graduate Student Research (GSR) Positions Research positions afford excellent opportunities for graduate students to gain invaluable experience in areas of importance to your graduate education while receiving financial support. Information and application materials for GSR positions are available from the academic units. Graduate students working toward advanced degrees are given duties in undergraduate courses that may include conducting discussion or laboratory sections, grading student work and providing students with individual help in the subject. Teaching assistants are chosen for their excellent scholarship and promise as teachers. They serve apprenticeships under active tutelage and supervision of regular faculty members. Teaching assistants engage in learning how to teach and work closely with faculty mentors. A limited number of teaching assistantships are available each year. On the recommendation of the academic deans, the academic units make appointments to teaching assistantships. Fellowships are awarded primarily on the basis of merit and the promise of outstanding academic and professional achievement. Consideration is given to the extent and quality of previous undergraduate and graduate work, evidence of ability in research or other creative accomplishment, evidence of intellectual capacity and promise of productive scholarship. Financial need or the availability of other sources of support in your graduate program is not relevant to the evaluation of academic merit, but may be an additional criterion for some fellowships. Students must establish eligibility for need-based fellowships by filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). For faster and more accurate filing, students can complete the FAFSA online at Financial aid awards that require repayment, loans, offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. Some loan programs are based on financial need, but there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest loans. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans - Not based on financial need, these loans are available to all eligible students, regardless of income. This loan is “unsubsidized” in that the student is responsible for paying all interest due. There is no federal interest subsidy for the loan. Interest accrues immediately upon disbursement. Borrowers may elect to pay accrued interest on a monthly or quarterly basis or have it added back to the principal balance in a process called capitalization. PLUS Loans for Graduate and Professional Degree Students – Graduate and professional degree students are eligible to borrow under the PLUS Loan Program up to their cost of attendance minus other estimated financial assistance. The terms and conditions applicable to Parent PLUS Loans also apply to Graduate/Professional PLUS loans. These requirements include a determination that the applicant does not have an adverse credit history, repayment beginning on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Applicants for these loans are required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). They also must have applied for their annual loan maximum eligibility under the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program before applying for a Graduate/Professional PLUS loan. section under Financial Aid and Scholarships for more information on the academic requirements for student loans. General Requirements for Graduate Degrees Most requirements for graduate degree programs are determined by the Graduate Group that offers the degree. However, the Graduate Council, on behalf of the Academic Senate, has approval authority over all graduate programs on the Merced campus. Graduate students must complete a minimum of 4 units of letter-graded coursework, either upper division or graduate-level, at some point prior to receiving a graduate degree at UC Merced. If admitted for a second graduate degree, student will be held to all the usual degree requirements and University regulations pertaining to fees, examinations for advancement to candidacy, residency, etc. Courses already applied to any previously earned graduate degree cannot be applied toward the requirements of the second degree. In accordance with the policy approved by the Graduate Council, the Graduate Dean has delegated the authority to admit students for a second Master’s degree to the Graduate Groups. While official policy is to discourage duplication of degrees, graduate groups may allow more than one degree at the same level, including more than one academic or professional master’s. Admissions for a second Ph.D. is rarely granted and must be handled as an exception to policy and approved by the Graduate Dean. All requests must be made in writing to the Dean and should include strong justification for admitting the applicant for a second Ph.D., as well as a statement assuring the Dean that the applicant’s first Ph.D. is an unrelated area and that there will be no duplication or waiving of coursework. Transfer of credit toward Master’s degree requirements are governed by the University regulation and policy summarized in the Graduate Policies and Procedures Handbook. Courses taken toward a graduate degree at another institution cannot be transferred for credit toward a Ph.D. at UCM. However a course requirement may be waived if a similar course was taken at another institution."

We ensure that a world-class education is an affordable reality. UC Merced administers various financial aid programs and scholarship resources to assist students in meeting their educational expenses. (Note: Aid is not available for students on special or limited enrollment status, or students enrolled in University Extension except for students enrolled in the Teacher Preparation Program.) All students, regardless of family income, are encouraged to apply for financial aid. About 90 percent of UC Merced undergraduate students received some form of financial assistance. Financial aid is intended both to remove financial barriers for families who cannot afford the cost of a higher education, and to fill in the gap for families who can afford a portion of the cost. Several factors, in addition to family income, are considered in determining your financial eligibility, including family size, assets, and whether the student will be living on or off-campus. Although most grant awards are based on financial need, some scholarships and loans are available regardless of need. The OFAS has bilingual advising staff who are dedicated to helping students and their parents navigate the application process and understand the financial aid opportunities available at UC Merced. The OFAS welcomes your questions and is here to provide services and guidance that will contribute to your educational experiences at UC Merced. If you have questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact our Students First Center (SFC) for assistance. Students applying for financial aid from UC Merced, the Federal Government and/or the state of California must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the California Dream Act Application (CADAA). The FAFSA or CADAA, as well as the Cal Grant GPA Verification form, should be completed and submitted as soon as possible after October 1 priority deadline has already passed, you are encouraged to still apply as a late applicant as some funding may still be available.

Students who receive financial aid may receive funds from one or more of the following sources: grants, scholarships loans and work-study. funded by federal and state governments, foundations, corporations, and/or non-profit organizations. Recipients are typically determined based on financial need, or in connection with a research proposal or project, and awards do not have to be repaid. The proceeds of the grants are used to help offset recipients’ cost of education and/or research expenses. The Federal Government provides funds for Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The State of California also offers Cal Grants (A and B), Middle Class Scholarships (MCS), and Chafee Grant for current or former foster youth to qualified undergraduate students. Additionally, institutional grant funds are provided by the University of California. The Pell Grant program is the largest student grant program administered by the federal government. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, applicants must complete a FAFSA, be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, be enrolled in their initial undergraduate degree program (or post-baccalaureate Teacher Preparation program), have demonstrated financial need, are not in default of a federal student loan, and maintain satisfactory academic progress. Lifetime eligibility is limited to 12-semesters / 18-quarters (i.e., 6-years) of full-time equivalent awards. Pell Grant maximum awards for full-time students may change from year to year depending on Congressional appropriations. The award amount depends on your Student Aid Index (SAI) as determined by completing the FAFSA, as well as your enrollment intensity (percentage of full-time enrollment at shich a student is enrolled). Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) The SEOG program is a federal campus‐based program designed to supplement other sources of financial aid for undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional financial need based on FAFSA data. As a federal campus‐based program, annual SEOG allocations are provided to individual universities in varying amounts, based on the school’s enrollment data, and may be awarded to students at the school’s discretion within the parameters of federal student aid eligibility guidelines. Therefore, SEOG fund availability, award amounts, and eligibility requirements vary from university to university. Due to our limited allocation, we award this grant to our neediest students first until funds are exhausted. The Cal Grant Program is a state-funded grant program administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) to assist California resident and AB540 students who meet the eligibility criteria, demonstrate financial need, and meet appropriate application deadlines, in paying for their education to attend a California college or university. These awards do not need to be repaid by the student. Cal Grant awards may be renewed for up to three additional years if the recipient continues to meet the income, asset, unmet need, enrollment level, academic progress, and the aid application priority filing deadline parameters as outlined by CSAC. Recipients of these awards may also apply for a fifth year of funding while enrolled in eligible teaching credential programs. More information about Cal Grants can be found on CSAC’s website. awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees. Note: It does not cover campus-based fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. For first-year students, Cal Grant B provides a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. For students in their second through fourth years, it covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees, plus a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. Please note if you are a Cal Grant recipient, in order to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) provides undergraduate students, including students pursuing a teaching credential, with a scholarship to attend a University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) campus. Students with family income and assets up to $226,000 may be eligible. Award amounts are determined by the California Student Aid Commission and will take into account any federal Pell Grant, Cal Grant, UC Merced Bobcat Grant and scholarships you have been awarded. CSAC administers the Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program through an interagency agreement with the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program provides eligible California youth aging out of the foster care with financial assistance to attend an eligible postsecondary institution. Students may be eligible to receive up to $5,000 per year. The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Application is available on CSAC’s website. The University of California returns a portion of all tuition revenue to financial aid programs. UC Merced uses this funding to provide a need-based institutional grant program (Bobcat Grants) to eligible students. Bobcat Grant eligibility is determined using the UC Education Financing Model (EFM) formula approved by the UC Regents for all UC campuses. The UC Blue & Gold opportunity Plan is a guarantee to students whose family income is below $80,000 per year that they will be awarded enough gift-aid from a combination of federal, state, and/or institutional funds to at least cover their UC systemwide tuition and fees. As part of the UC President’s initiative to create a pathway toward reduced student loan indebtedness, low-income students who meet the eligibility criteria will be awarded additional grant intended to help meet your total cost of attending UC Merced. This additional funding effectively reduces the dollar amount you will be responsible for paying out of pocket while also reducing your need to borrow student loans, thereby creating a potential pathway toward a debt-free UC education. Costs not covered by grants and scholarships could potentially be met by earning wages through part-time work or savings; however, you are still entitled to borrow the maximum student loan amount for which you are eligible. Every student’s circumstances are different, and we encourage you to consult with a Financial Aid Advisor to consider your options. UC students enrolled in a degree program who are California residents and are enrolled in federally recognized Native American, American Indian, and Alaska Native tribes will have their UC systemwide tuition and fees fully covered with gift-aid from federal, state, institutional and/or Tribal funds. Note: Students who are potentially eligible must submit tribal enrollment documentation from their federally recognized tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Contact our office for more information. UC Merced administers various scholarships designed to assist undergraduate students with their educational costs. These scholarships are provided through the generosity of UC alumni, Friends of UC Merced, corporations, businesses, professional associations, and UC Merced. These scholarships include: Merit-Based/Academic Scholarships (i.e., outstanding academic performance, talents, and leadership ability. May include intended area of interest); and, Need-Based Scholarships (i.e., demonstrated financial need from the FAFSA or CADAA. May include academic performance). For new students, one application does it all! All incoming students are automatically considered for institutional scholarships administered by the OFAS simply by submitting a FAFSA (citizen/eligible non-citizens) or CADAA (undocumented students) by March 2. New students must have at least a 3.25 GPA to be considered for most scholarships. If the student has been awarded a scholarship by an external entity, they are obligated to report it to us via their UC Merced Connect portal so we can add it to their financial aid award package. Additional external scholarship opportunities are posted on our website at ucmerced.academicworks.com/opportunities/external Continuing students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA as of the end of the prior fall semester to be considered for institutional scholarships. Continuing students must submit a FAFSA or CADAA AND a Continuing Student Scholarship Application online by March 2nd. Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment with interest. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning the loans are processed through the U.S. Department of Education and are funded by the U.S. Treasury. This ensures that the borrower will have a reliable and predictable source of funding. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. Payments and interest begin six months after the student either graduates or drops below half-time enrollment. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school but may opt to defer any interest payments until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. If interest is deferred, it will be capitalized (i.e., added to the loan balance) when repayment begins. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. If the parent-borrower does not qualify for a PLUS Loan, they may either: Obtain an Endorser (i.e., another adult with good credit who is willing to co-sign the loan); or If the parent cannot locate an Endorser, the dependent student may then qualify to borrow additional Unsubsidized loan funds on their own. Undocumented students who graduate from a California high school and meet the CA Dream Act requirements are eligible for state and university aid; however, they are ineligible for federal aid including federal loans. The CA DREAM loan program helps close that gap by providing eligible students with the opportunity to borrow student loans to help pay for their education. There is no interest while the student is enrolled at least half-time working toward a degree. Payments and interest begin six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. The State of California requires that students be informed of the following: Federal student loans are available to students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Alternative loans are funds available to students who are not eligible for financial aid, or they need additional funds to meet their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance minus other financial aid or the annual loan maximum amount as determined by the lender. Because alternative loans are not guaranteed by the federal government, they must be insured privately. This extra cost is passed on to the borrower in the form of higher fees and interest rates. In addition, the lender will look at your credit history as well as other factors to determine if they will lend to you. You may be denied by one lender and approved by another because of the way the lender interprets your information. Students should exhaust all federal student loan eligibility before borrowing private student loans. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program is a federal campus-based program designed to provide eligible students an opportunity to work part-time (i.e., up to 18 hours per week during an academic term), typically on-campus, while earning money to help pay for their educational-related expenses. Jobs are available with flexible schedules that can be adjusted around each student’s classes. Students may only earn up to the amount they are awarded for the year. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award online at UC Merced Connect. All FWS and non-FWS jobs are posted online at UC Merced’s Handshake page. Learning-Aligned Employment Program (LAEP) The Learning Aligned Employment Program (LAEP) is funded by the California Student Aid Commission to support students with financial need. LAEP provides funds to participating public postsecondary educational institutions to offer eligible students opportunities to earn money to help pay their educational costs while gaining Research Assistant experience with faculty. For more information, please contact the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC). Financial aid programs are subject to myriad federal, state, UC, and institutional regulations that students must meet to qualify and maintain their aid eligibility. These requirements generally include: Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S. and complete the FAFSA, OR live in California and meet the requirements for non-resident exemption AB540 status and complete the CA Dream Act Application (CADAA), Be accepted for admission to the University. Be enrolled at least half-time and in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted for financial aid purposes, except for the Teacher Preparation Program). Demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans). Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for financial aid, as outlined below. Not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Note: Financial need is the difference between the Cost of Attendance (based on living on-campus, off-campus, or at home) and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student, and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Please note, if you are a Cal Grant recipient, in order to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. UC Merced will be confirming academic activity for undergraduate and graduate students each semester. We will recalculate financial aid after the 15th day of instruction for all undergraduate and graduate aid recipients based on their enrollment status in those classes which we can confirm that the student began attendance. If we are unable to document the student’s attendance in a class, via the learning management system (i.e., CatCourses) activity or instructor reporting, aid will be adjusted to exclude the units for that class. Student will have an opportunity to appeal if they have supporting documentation confirming their attendance. The Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards listed below apply to all aid applicants, whether aid was received for prior coursework. A student’s eligibility for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is affected by this policy. Note: some funds have higher academic and/or enrollment requirements. : In addition to the requirements listed below, all students, whether receiving aid or not, must also meet the university’s academic GPA standards established by the Registrar. Please refer to the Registrar’s website for these standards. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, students must meet all three standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, and a maximum time frame. If a student fails to meet any standard, they will be notified that they are ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for financial aid will only be reinstated if the student subsequently meets the SAP requirements or if the student successfully appeals. SAP Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Students must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 66.7 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). The pace calculation includes all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e., independent study courses). Required remedial courses are included in the Pace calculation. tudents are eligible for financial aid for up to Student’s Maximum Timeframe (180 units) = UCM Attempted Units + Up to 70 Accepted Transfer Units Students exceeding the maximum timeframe will be ineligible to receive financial aid. Students will not be granted additional eligibility solely by reason of changing their major or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Every unit attempted (that receives a grade) is counted toward the maximum timeframe. Units earned during terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Maximum timeframe measure also includes all the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Units earned during summer terms attended are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Accepted transfer units taken between (non-current) enrollment at UC Merced will be added to the total number of transfer units the student has and will be used to determine maximum timeframe. Transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program, up to 70, are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Students pursuing a double-major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Post-Baccalaureate (Teacher Preparation Program) Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Student must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 66.7 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. All transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). The pace calculation includes all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e., independent study courses). Required remedial courses are included in the Pace calculation. Teacher Preparation Program students are eligible to receive financial aid for up to following completion of their program (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). All post-baccalaureate financial aid applicants exceeding this unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 66.7 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation.

However, UC Merced allows a student to appeal their financial aid ineligibility if they have special circumstances that prevented them from meeting SAP. Special circumstances include but are not limited to significant life events such as the death or illness of a loved one, personal injury or illness, pregnancy, homelessness, loss of childcare or transportation, employment changes, becoming a crime victim, family issues, financial difficulties, changes in academic major, and inability to access support services can impact students Students are encouraged to submit an appeal as soon as they receive notification from the financial aid office. SAP appeals are reviewed within three to four weeks from the time a complete appeal is submitted. A complete SAP Appeal includes a statement explaining special circumstances, a plan for improvement, and supporting documentation. The appeal is available online at and paper copies are available upon request. Instructions for completing the appeal are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP policy. Appeals may be submitted in any term after a student does not meet the SAP policy. Appeals can be submitted online or in person at the Financial Aid Office. Supporting documentation for special circumstances is required. This may include letters from medical providers, degree or academic planning materials from a college advisor, or supporting statements from other on-campus support services such as Student Accessibility Services. UC Merced recognizes that, in some instances, it can be unreasonable or potentially re-traumatizing to produce supporting documentation. A student who cannot reasonably produce documentation should Academic Advisors will create academic plans for all appeal submissions when the student has a cumulative GPA of 1.0 or less or 90+ completed units. The plan ensures that, if followed, the student will maintain sufficient progress toward their degree. Academic plans become part of the Terms and Conditions a student must follow if their appeal is approved. Approval will be based on the student’s circumstances that hindered their academic progress, supporting documentation, and a reasonable expectation that the student can reestablish progress toward a degree objective. If the appeal is approved, the student will be informed via email notifying them to review and accept Terms and Conditions. Financial aid will not disburse until the Terms and Conditions are accepted. Financial aid eligibility is reinstated for one term at a time within the academic year, until the OFAS evaluates SAP for all students at the end of spring. The OFAS monitors adherence to Terms and Conditions at the end of every term and only extends financial aid eligibility to the following term if the Terms and Conditions from the term prior are met. If a student’s appeal is denied, they will be informed via email notifying them of their option to request a second review by a reviewer who did not participate in the initial review. Requests for a second review for a denied appeal must be submitted in writing. Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, financial aid funds are disbursed into the student’s university account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. All funds are applied to institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate. Students withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: The date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or The date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who enroll in the Educational Leave Program are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of their intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. IMPORTANT WARNING: The duration of your financial aid eligibility is limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave for a term after aid is disbursed you use up one semester of eligibility! For many students, college is the first time they are in control of their own finances. In 2020, we launched UC Merced’s Financial Wellness Center (FWC). The Center provides education and empowerment on money management topics relevant to college life and beyond. This is accomplished through the delivery of digital content, interactive workshops, classroom engagement, special campus events, and personalized financial coaching sessions, as well as working closely with the Basic Needs Office and the Dean of Students. Coaching topics include Personal Budgeting, Bank Accounts, Moving Off-Campus, Paychecks, Insurance, Salary Negotiation, Credit Scores, Homebuying, Investing, Student Loan Repayment, Car Buying, Leases, ID Theft, Retirement, Emergency Savings, Financial Crisis."

We ensure that a world-class education is an affordable reality. UC Merced administers various financial aid programs and scholarship resources to assist students in meeting their educational expenses. (Note: Aid is not available for students on special or limited enrollment status, or students enrolled in University Extension except for students enrolled in the Teacher Preparation Program.) All students, regardless of family income, are encouraged to apply for financial aid. About 90 percent of UC Merced undergraduate students received some form of financial assistance. Financial aid is intended both to remove financial barriers for families who cannot afford the cost of a higher education, and to fill in the gap for families who can afford a portion of the cost. Several factors, in addition to family income, are considered in determining your financial eligibility, including household size, number of family members in college, assets, and whether the student will be living on or off-campus. Although most grant awards are based on financial need, some scholarships and loans are available regardless of need. The OFAS has bilingual advising staff who are dedicated to helping students and their parents navigate the application process and understand the financial aid opportunities available to them at UC Merced. The OFAS welcomes your questions and is here to provide services and guidance that will contribute to your educational experiences at UC Merced. If you have questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact our Students First Center (SFC) for assistance. Students applying for financial aid from UC Merced, the Federal Government and/or the state of California must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the California Dream Act Application (CADAA). The FAFSA or CADAA, as well as the Cal Grant GPA Verification form, should be completed and submitted as soon as possible after October 1 priority deadline has already passed, you are encouraged to still apply as a late applicant as some funding may still be available. Apply as soon as possible! We receive and process financial aid applications throughout the academic year. A financial aid advisor is available to assist students and parents with the financial aid application process and can review any special circumstances that may affect aid eligibility. Please contact our SFC for assistance. New students who are citizens FAFSA-eligible non-citizens: Complete and submit the FAFSA and ensure a verified GPA was submitted to the California Student Aid Commission by March 2nd (GPA is typically transmitted electronically to the Commission by most high schools for incoming freshman). Complete and return any additional documents requested by the OFAS by June 1st. New students who are undocumented and AB540 eligible: Complete and submit the CADAA and ensure a verified GPA was submitted to the California Student Aid Commission by March 2nd (GPA is typically transmitted electronically to the Commission by most high schools for incoming freshman). Complete a UC Merced Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) application if required on your Student Portal Checklist in Connect. Students will be evaluated for AB 540 status as part of the SLR process. Complete and return any additional documents requested by the OFAS by June 1st. Continuing Students who are citizens or FAFSA-eligible non-citizens: Complete and submit the FAFSA by March 2nd. Complete and submit a UC Merced Continuing Student Scholarship Application online between February 1st and March 2nd. Complete and return any additional documents requested by the OFAS by June 1st.

Complete and submit a UC Merced Continuing Student Scholarship Application between February 1st and March 2nd. Complete and return any additional documentation requested by the OFAS by June 1st. Complete either the FAFSA or CADAA for the most recent academic year (e.g., 2021-22 FAFSA for summer 2022), if you haven’t already done so. Complete the Summer Financial Aid Web Application in March of each year. Comply with any requests for additional information. Students who receive financial aid may receive funds from one or more of the following sources: grants, scholarships loans and work-study. funded by federal and state governments, foundations, corporations, and/or non-profit organizations. Recipients are typically determined based on financial need, or in connection with a research proposal or project, and awards do not have to be repaid. The proceeds of the grants are used to help offset recipients’ cost of education and/or research expenses. The Federal Government provides funds for Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The State of California also offers Cal Grants (A and B), Middle Class Scholarships (MCS), and Chafee Grant for current or former foster youth to qualified undergraduate students. Additionally, institutional grant funds are provided by the University of California. The Pell Grant program is the largest student grant program administered by the federal government. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, applicants must complete a FAFSA, be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, be enrolled in their initial undergraduate degree program (or post-baccalaureate Teacher Preparation program), have demonstrated financial need, are not in default of a federal student loan, and maintain satisfactory academic progress. Lifetime eligibility is limited to 12-semesters / 18-quarters (i.e., 6-years) of full-time equivalent awards. Pell Grant maximum awards for full-time students may change from year to year depending on Congressional appropriations. The award amount depends on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as determined by completing the FAFSA, as well as your enrollment load (i.e., full-time, ¾-time, ½-time, less than ½-time). Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) The SEOG program is a federal campus‐based program designed to supplement other sources of financial aid for undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional financial need based on FAFSA data. As a federal campus‐based program, annual SEOG allocations are provided to individual universities in varying amounts, based on the school’s enrollment data, and may be awarded to students at the school’s discretion within the parameters of federal student aid eligibility guidelines. Therefore, SEOG fund availability, award amounts, and eligibility requirements vary from university to university. Due to our limited allocation, we award this grant to our neediest students first until funds are exhausted. The Cal Grant Program is a state-funded grant program administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) to assist California resident and AB540 students who meet the eligibility criteria, demonstrate financial need, and meet appropriate application deadlines, in paying for their education to attend a California college or university. These awards do not need to be repaid by the student. Cal Grant awards may be renewed for up to three additional years if the recipient continues to meet the income, asset, unmet need, enrollment level, academic progress, and the aid application priority filing deadline parameters as outlined by CSAC. Recipients of these awards may also apply for a fifth year of funding while enrolled in eligible teaching credential programs. More information about Cal Grants can be found on CSAC’s website. awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees. Note: It does not cover campus-based fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. For first-year students, Cal Grant B provides a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. For students in their second through fourth years, it covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees, plus a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. Please note if you are a Cal Grant recipient, to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) provides undergraduate students, including students pursuing a teaching credential, with a scholarship to attend a University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) campus. Students with family income and assets up to $217,000 may be eligible. Award amounts are determined by the California Student Aid Commission and will take into account any federal Pell Grant, Cal Grant, UC Merced Bobcat Grant and scholarships you have been awarded. CSAC administers the Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program through an interagency agreement with the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program provides eligible California youth aging out of the foster care with financial assistance to attend an eligible postsecondary institution. Students may be eligible to receive up to $5,000 per year. The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Application is available on CSAC’s website. The University of California returns a portion of all tuition revenue to financial aid programs. UC Merced uses this funding to provide a need-based institutional grant program (Bobcat Grants) to eligible students. Bobcat Grant eligibility is determined using the UC Education Financing Model (EFM) formula approved by the UC Regents for all UC campuses. The UC Blue & Gold opportunity Plan is a guarantee to students whose family income is below $80,000 per year that they will be awarded enough gift-aid from a combination of federal, state, and/or institutional funds to at least cover their UC systemwide tuition and fees. As part of the UC President’s initiative to create a pathway toward reduced student loan indebtedness, low-income students who meet the eligibility criteria will be awarded additional grant intended to help meet your total cost of attending UC Merced. This additional funding effectively reduces the dollar amount you will be responsible for paying out of pocket while also reducing your need to borrow student loans, thereby creating a potential pathway toward a Debt Free UC education. Costs not covered by grants and scholarships could potentially be met by earning wages through part-time work or savings; however, you are still entitled to borrow the maximum student loan amount for which you are eligible. Every student’s circumstances are different, and we encourage you to consult with a Financial Aid Advisor to consider your options. UC students enrolled in a degree program who are California residents and are enrolled in federally recognized Native American, American Indian, and Alaska Native tribes will have their UC systemwide tuition and fees fully covered with gift-aid from federal, state, institutional and/or Tribal funds. Note: Students who are potentially eligible must submit tribal enrollment documentation from their federally recognized tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Contact our office for more information. UC Merced administers various scholarships designed to assist undergraduate students with their educational costs. These scholarships are provided through the generosity of UC alumni, Friends of UC Merced, corporations, businesses, professional associations, and UC Merced. These scholarships include: Merit-Based/Academic Scholarships (i.e., outstanding academic performance, talents, and leadership ability. May include intended area of interest); and, Need-Based Scholarships (i.e., demonstrated financial need from the FAFSA or CADAA. May include academic performance). For new students, one application does it all! All incoming students are automatically considered for institutional scholarships administered by the OFAS simply by submitting a FAFSA (citizen/eligible non-citizens) or CA Dream Act Application (undocumented students) by March 2. New students must have at least a 3.25 GPA to be considered for most scholarships. If the student has been awarded a scholarship by an external entity, they are obligated to report it to us via their UC Merced Connect portal so we can add it to their financial aid award package. Additional external scholarship opportunities are posted on our website at ucmerced.academicworks.com/opportunities/external Continuing students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA as of the end of the prior fall semester to be considered for institutional scholarships. Continuing students must submit a FAFSA or CADAA AND a Continuing Student Scholarship Application online by March 2nd. Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment with interest. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. Federal Stafford Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning the loans are processed through the U.S. Department of Education and are funded by the U.S. Treasury. This ensures that the borrower will have a reliable and predictable source of funding. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. Payments and interest begin six months after the student either graduates or drops below half-time enrollment. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school but may opt to defer any interest payments until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. If interest is deferred, it will be capitalized (i.e., added to the loan balance) when repayment begins. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Stafford Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. If the parent-borrower does not qualify for a PLUS Loan, they may either: Obtain an Endorser (i.e., another adult with good credit who is willing to co-sign the loan); or If the parent cannot locate an Endorser, the dependent student may then qualify to borrow additional Unsubsidized loan funds on their own. Undocumented students who graduate from a California high school and meet the CA Dream Act requirements are eligible for state and university aid; however, they are ineligible for federal aid including federal loans. The CA DREAM loan program helps close that gap by providing eligible students with the opportunity to borrow student loans to help pay for their education. There is no interest while the student is enrolled at least half-time working toward a degree. Payments and interest begin six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time working toward a degree. The State of California requires that students be informed of the following: Federal student loans are available to students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Alternative loans are funds available to students who are not eligible for financial aid, or they need additional funds to meet their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance minus other financial aid or the annual loan maximum amount as determined by the lender. Because alternative loans are not guaranteed by the federal government, they must be insured privately. This extra cost is passed on to the borrower in the form of higher fees and interest rates. In addition, the lender will look at your credit history as well as other factors to determine if they will lend to you. You may be denied by one lender and approved by another because of the way the lender interprets your information. Students should exhaust all federal student loan eligibility before borrowing private student loans. More information about Loans can be found on the OFAS website. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program is a federal campus-based program designed to provide eligible students an opportunity to work part-time (i.e., up to 18 hours per week during an academic term), typically on-campus, while earning money to help pay for their educational-related expenses. Jobs are available with flexible schedules that can be adjusted around each student’s classes. Students may only earn up to the amount they are awarded for the year. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their Federal Work-Study award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award online at UC Merced Connect. All FWS and non-FWS jobs are posted online at UC Merced’s Handshake page. Learning-Aligned Employment Program (LAEP) The Learning Aligned Employment Program (LAEP) is funded by the California Student Aid Commission to support students with financial need. LAEP provides funds to participating public postsecondary educational institutions to offer eligible students opportunities to earn money to help pay their educational costs while gaining Research Assistant experience with faculty. For more information, please contact the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC). Financial aid programs are subject to myriad federal, state, UC, and institutional regulations that students must meet to qualify and maintain their aid eligibility. These requirements generally include: Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S. and complete the FAFSA, OR live in California and meet the requirements for non-resident exemption AB540 status and complete the CA Dream Act Application (CADAA), Be accepted for admission to the University. Be enrolled at least half-time and in good standing at the University (units taken through University Extension are not counted for financial aid purposes, except for the Teacher Preparation Program). Demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans). Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for financial aid, as outlined below. Not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Note: Financial need is the difference between the Cost of Attendance (based on living on-campus, off-campus, or at home) and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student, and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. Please note, if you are a Cal Grant recipient, to graduate before your 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted, you will need to enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 semester units per academic year. UC Merced will be confirming academic activity for undergraduate and graduate students each semester. We will recalculate financial aid after the 15th day of instruction for all undergraduate and graduate aid recipients based on their enrollment status in those classes which we can confirm that the student began attendance. If we are unable to document the student’s attendance in a class, via the learning management system (i.e., CatCourses) activity or instructor reporting, aid will be adjusted to exclude the units for that class. Student will have an opportunity to appeal if they have supporting documentation confirming their attendance. More information about Academic Activity can be found on the OFAS website. The Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards listed below apply to all aid applicants, whether aid was received for prior coursework. A student’s eligibility for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is affected by this policy. Note: some funds have higher academic and/or enrollment requirements. : In addition to the requirements listed below, all students, whether receiving aid or not, must also meet the university’s academic GPA standards established by the Registrar. Please refer to the Registrar’s website for these standards. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, students must meet all three standards: a GPA requirement, a pace requirement, and a maximum time frame. If a student fails to meet any standard, they will be notified that they are ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for financial aid will only be reinstated if the student subsequently meets the SAP requirements or if the student successfully appeals. SAP Appeals are only accepted one time per year, at the end of spring semester. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Students must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 66.7 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). The pace calculation includes all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e., independent study courses). Required remedial courses are included in the Pace calculation. tudents are eligible for financial aid for up to Student’s Maximum Timeframe (180 units) = UCM Attempted Units + Up to 70 Accepted Transfer Units Students exceeding the maximum timeframe will be ineligible to receive financial aid. Students will not be granted additional eligibility solely by reason of changing their major or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Every unit attempted (that receives a grade) is counted toward the maximum timeframe. Units earned during terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Maximum timeframe measure also includes all the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Units earned during summer terms attended are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Accepted transfer units taken between (non-current) enrollment at UC Merced will be added to the total number of transfer units the student has and will be used to determine maximum timeframe. Transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program, up to 70, are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Students pursuing a double-major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. Post-Baccalaureate (Teacher Preparation Program) Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Student must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA upon the conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 66.7 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript.

If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e., independent study courses). Required remedial courses are included in the Pace calculation. Teacher Preparation Program students are eligible to receive financial aid for up to following completion of their baccalaureate degree (regardless of whether they received financial aid during these terms). All post-baccalaureate financial aid applicants exceeding this unit limit will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Students will not be granted additional units of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (Qualitative) Students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon conclusion of the spring term each academic year. All students must complete at least 66.7 percent of the units attempted each year to keep pace toward graduation.

More information about SAP can be found on the OFAS website. Students wishing to appeal must submit a SAP Appeal to the OFAS by the posted deadline. The appeal form is available online and instructions are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP standards. The SAP Appeal deadline is published annually on the OFAS website. Appeals will only be considered once per academic year for all students notified that they must complete the appeal process. If a student does not meet the appeal deadline, they can submit a written request to the OFAS to be considered to submit a late appeal. All appeals must include a statement that explains the reason(s) for failing to meet the SAP requirements. Students must demonstrate some type of extenuating circumstances that hindered academic performance during the term(s) in question, such as death of an immediate family member, major medical issue, etc. Appeals must also include a plan that explains the strategies they will use to meet the SAP requirements by the conclusion of the outlined timeframe. Supporting documentation of the extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the OFAS once the appeal statement and plan for improvement have been submitted electronically. The documentation should be date-specific and from a disinterested third party. Appeals submitted without supporting documentation will not be reviewed. Once received by the OFAS, the appeal is reviewed for completeness. Appeals are considered incomplete until documentation is received. Once accepted, appeals are evaluated by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee within three to four weeks. Approval will be based on the student’s circumstances that hindered their academic progress, supporting documentation, and a reasonable expectation that the student can reestablish progress toward a degree objective. Academic Advisors will create academic plans for all appeal submissions when the student has a cumulative GPA of 1.0 or less or 90+ completed units. The plan ensures that, if followed, the student will maintain sufficient progress toward their degree. Academic plans become part of the Terms and Conditions a student must follow if their appeal is approved. If the appeal is approved, the student will be informed via email notifying them to review and accept Terms and Conditions. Financial aid will not disburse until the Terms and Conditions are accepted. Financial aid eligibility is reinstated for one term at a time within the academic year, until the OFAS evaluates SAP for all students at the end of spring. The OFAS monitors adherence to Terms and Conditions at the end of every term and only extends financial aid eligibility to the following term if the Terms and Conditions from the term prior are met. If the appeal is denied, the student will be informed via email that the decision is final, and no subsequent review of the appeal will be permitted. More information about the SAP Appeal Process can be found on the OFAS website. Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year and an equal amount is made available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Business Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. If all necessary requirements are complete, financial aid funds are disbursed into the student’s university account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. All funds are applied to institutional charges first. The remaining amount will be applied toward the authorized charges on the student’s account or will be refunded to the student or parent as appropriate. Students withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used in determining the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the earliest of the following: The date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or The date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of his/her intent to withdraw; or UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who enroll in the Educational Leave Program are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of their intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented him/her from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. More information about Withdrawing can be found on the OFAS website. IMPORTANT WARNING: The duration of your financial aid eligibility is limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave for a term after aid is disbursed you use up one semester of eligibility! For many students, college is the first time they are in control of their own finances. In 2020, we launched UC Merced’s Financial Wellness Center (FWC). The Center provides education and empowerment on money management topics relevant to college life and beyond. This is accomplished through the delivery of digital content, interactive workshops, classroom engagement, special campus events, and personalized financial coaching sessions, as well as working closely with the Basic Needs Office and the Dean of Students. Coaching topics include Personal Budgeting, Bank Accounts, Moving Off-Campus, Paychecks, Insurance, Salary Negotiation, Credit Scores, Homebuying, Investing, Student Loan Repayment, Car Buying, Leases, ID Theft, Retirement, Emergency Savings, Financial Crisis."

Learn more here: admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/exam-requirement/ HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR GRADE-POINT AVERAGE The grade-point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before 12th grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four-point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before 12th grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during 12th grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level courses. Honors courses are Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and designated Standard Level courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school’s course list. Courses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade. No more than two units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 can be assigned extra points. D grades are not assigned extra points. Students who receive D or F grades in “a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or a more advanced level in the same subject. The omission of a yearlong course in Geometry cannot be validated by a more advanced level math course. For more information about meeting and validating the Geometry requirement, please see page 20 in the Quick Reference Guide to UC Admissions at admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/_files/documents/quick-reference.pdf . Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International First Year Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international first year applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade-point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 6.5. For more information visit Take the Duolingo English Test (DET) and earn a minimum score of 115 or better. For more information visit All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors can be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as a first year: Academic grade point average in all completed A-G courses, including additional points for completed UC-certified honors courses. Number of, content of and performance in academic courses beyond the minimum A-G requirements. Number of and performance in UC-approved honors, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and transferable college courses. Identification by UC as being ranked in the top 9 percent of your high school class at the end of your junior year (Eligible in the Local Context, or ELC). Quality of your senior-year program as measured by the type and number of academic courses in progress or planned. Quality of your academic performance relative to the educational opportunities available in your high school. Outstanding performance in one or more specific subject areas. Outstanding work in one or more special projects in any academic field of study. Recent, marked improvement in academic performance, as demonstrated by academic GPA and the quality of coursework completed or in progress. Special talents, achievements and awards in a particular field, such as visual and performing arts, communication or athletic endeavors; special skills, such as demonstrated written and oral proficiency in other languages; special interests, such as intensive study and exploration of other cultures; experiences that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, such as significant community service or significant participation in student government; or other significant experiences or achievements that demonstrate the student’s promise for contributing to the intellectual vitality of a campus. Completion of special projects undertaken in the context of your high school curriculum or in conjunction with special school events, projects or programs. Academic accomplishments in light of your life experiences and special circumstances, including but not limited to: disabilities, low family income, first generation to attend college, need to work, disadvantaged social or educational environment, difficult personal and family situations or circumstances, refugee status or veteran status. Location of your secondary school and residence. If you enrolled in a regular session of college- or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a first year. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges who have completed at least 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units). To be considered for admission to UC Merced as a transfer student, you must fulfill either the junior-level or lower division transfer requirements. In addition, you will be required to complete the preparation requirements for your intended major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available at admissions.ucmerced.edu/transfer/major-preparation-schools If you are enrolled at a California Community College, you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower-division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman and sophomore-level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition, you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the Transfer Credit Practices Section of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found at Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter-grade basis will be computed into the grade-point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of AR, EW, W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your GPA. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. If you have attended only community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit, and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university can have up to 79 transferable semester (118 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer without a dean’s review. Applicants with 80 semester (120 quarter) units or more; a dean’s review is required. Transfer Credit Policy for University of California, Merced, Effective Fall 2018 The University of California, Merced, grants unit credit for college courses completed at United States colleges and universities accredited by the seven formerly regional accrediting agencies; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Courses determined to be essentially the same as courses offered for an undergraduate degree at any UC campus will be granted credit, if the course: Is listed in the original institution’s catalog/website of official courses offered for the year in which the course was completed, and Includes the same or similar content, and Requires the same or similar prerequisite coursework, and Is offered at the same level of instruction. Courses that further the student’s knowledge and understanding in fundamental liberal arts disciplines such as mathematics, natural science, literature, social sciences, fine arts and philosophy are acceptable for transfer if comparable in scope and depth to those offered at the UC. Courses accepted for transfer must be reported on an official transcript (academic record), which must be provided to UC Merced in a sealed envelope from the original college/university of enrollment, bearing the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. UC does not award credit posted to a third-party institution’s transcript. Credit is only considered from the original institution’s official academic record. work or volunteer experience, vocational or technical training, and personal enrichment courses; remedial academic or pre-baccalaureate courses, especially in English and mathematics; or College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) exams. Courses completed at unaccredited/non-regionally accredited institutions may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. UC Merced can award lower-division (freshman/sophomore level) units for military courses completed if the courses are consistent with the University policy on granting transfer credit when there is an equivalent course taught at a UC campus. UC Merced will consult the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations for information regarding course content as a guide to the awarding of credit. Courses from enrollment at another UC main campus (not UC Extension) during a regular academic (fall, winter, spring) or summer term are all transferable. Courses from enrollment at any UC Extension division are transferable if the course is numbered X1- X199; courses numbered 1-199 which include a campus designation (e.g. XB, XLA) are equivalent to the same course offered to undergraduates on that campus. Students will be granted up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any other institution or any combination of other institutions. For units beyond the maximum allowed, subject credit for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation will be granted and can be used to satisfy requirements. Units earned through AP, IB and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. Units earned at any UC campus (Extension, summer, cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. Note: if all courses are completed at one or more 2-year (community) colleges, a student would never be in danger of having too many (excessive) units. In addition, there is a limit to the number of units for which UC Merced grants credit in the following areas: English as a Second Language courses: Maximum 8 semester/12 quarter units Physical Education activity courses: Maximum 4 semester/6 quarter units. A maximum of 8 semester/12 quarter units of PE Theory UC Merced will not grant credit for college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously completed course, or examination for which credit has already been granted, with the exception of the repeat of deficient (C-/D/F) course grades. UC Merced grants credit for examinations as follows: International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level GCE or Hong Kong Advanced Level (A-Levels) – unit credit could be granted for satisfactory grades and scores. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST) exams. Every California Community College has an agreement with the UC – a Transfer Course Agreement (TCA). The TCA specifies which courses receive UC credit. To learn if college courses from a California Community College are transferable to UC Merced, visit . These lists are updated throughout the year, so check ASSIST periodically to ensure you have the most current information. Other two-year and four-year Institutions: The UC does not have transfer course agreements with institutions other than the California Community Colleges. However, using ASSIST and/or referring to any UC campus’ general catalog can provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer to UC Merced. UC Merced does not grant credit for junior/community college programs that are technical or vocational, or programs that do not lead to further academic study at a university in the international country. Elementary/intermediate language courses: No credit is granted to students who were instructed in that language during secondary school. Final determination on the transferability of coursework for credit will be made by UC Merced’s Office of Admissions, based on UC Merced’s review (not that of another institution).

Cancellation, Withdrawal and Fee Reversals To cancel registration before the first day of instruction or to withdraw from the University on or after the first day of instruction, you must complete a Cancellation/Withdrawal form and return the form to the Students First Center. If you do not submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form, you will be liable for fees according to University policy. It is very important that you contact the Students First Center and initiate withdrawal/leave of absence procedures even if your fees are fully paid by financial aid or other programs. Failing to do so may result in you owing money to the University. The effective date for determining a fee reversal is the date a Leaving UC Merced form is submitted. The percentage of fees that may be reversed is determined by the number of calendar days (not instruction days) elapsed, beginning with the first day of instruction for the semester. Failure to submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form: If you are not a financial aid recipient and you fail to submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form, you will be presumed to have attended school the entire semester and full fees will be due. If you are a financial aid recipient, you must contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships for information on how this will affect you. More information about withdrawing and financial aid can be found here: The $250 deposit paid with the Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) is not refundable. Any full or partial reversal of housing charges is made in accordance with the housing contract. Please refer to your contract for information related to contract cancellation. New Students Who Receive Title IV Federal Financial Assistance and Withdraw During their First Academic Term: Federal regulations require UC Merced to calculate the amount of federal financial aid that has been “earned” for all students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UC Merced during a semester. If the student withdraws prior to completing 60 percent of the semester, a pro-rated portion of the aid must be returned to the funding agency. The student’s account will be billed for any aid returned. All students will be assessed the student health insurance fee. Students who cancel all course registration on or before the first day of instruction are entitled to a full reversal of this fee. Insurance fees will not be reversed after the first day of instruction and coverage remains in effect until the date specified by the insurance plan. Charges other than the student services fee, tuition, nonresident supplemental tuition and campus-based fees are reversed according to guidelines and schedules published by the appropriate department."

Science, technology and innovation are the keys to future prosperity and quality of life. The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Following Majors: The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Natural Sciences Education Minor with Teaching Credential The value of science and mathematics has never been clearer. Now, more than ever, we need to work towards more affordable, clean and renewable sources of energy, safe and secure food chains, support for threatened ecosystems, clean and abundant water supplies, and the delivery of quality health care. You will find the courses you need to become the problem solvers of today and the innovators of tomorrow here in the School of Natural Sciences. Only through the efforts of a diverse team of scientists working in partnership with communities, businesses, and scholars from other disciplines can we solve the challenges facing our region, state, nation, and world. A degree in science will open doors to a multitude of practical and fulfilling careers, all of which can make the world a better place. Faculty in the School of Natural Sciences are committed to providing the next generation of problem-solvers with more than just information. We will teach you to apply scientific reasoning to ask and answer important questions using cutting-edge experimental, computational, and theoretical tools. Many of our graduates go to rewarding jobs upon receiving their diplomas, while others enroll in graduate or professional schools. No matter what path you choose, your life will benefit from being a well-trained scientist and member of our campus community. We welcome you to UC Merced and invite you to visit your faculty members and advisors to talk about the many exciting opportunities for you here in the School of Natural Sciences. Take advantage of every opportunity our remarkable School and Campus have to offer, get involved in faculty research, participate in community engaged scholarship, and be sure to explore field-based research activities – all of these (and more) are available to you in the School of Natural Sciences. “Bringing nature into the classroom can kindle a fascination and passion for the diversity of life on earth and can motivate a sense of responsibility to safeguard it.” The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and environmental systems science are the links to making discoveries about the natural world, the impact of human activities on that world and the impact of that world on human health. The academic programs in the School of Natural Sciences are designed to help students learn fundamental scientific principles in the context of the real world. Discovery consists in seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what no one else has thought. Answering questions requires creativity and innovation— creativity to think about a problem in a different way; to design the strategy to, for example, discover the gene(s) responsible for asthma, cancer or cardiovascular disease; to generate ideas for new technologies. Students in the School of Natural Sciences receive the foundational learning to create innovative technologies to solve problems and implement solutions. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. Understanding and prediction must precede protection. Students in the School of Natural Sciences fully understand the complex interactions between the physical and biological world and the consequences of society’s actions on the Earth and its biota. With this understanding, they are well positioned to manage and preserve our resources for future generations. Louis Pasteur’s theory of germs is ridiculous fiction. The understanding of science has improved and will continue to improve. Health and disease, prevention and treatment rely on understanding complex systems. Students in Natural Sciences at UC Merced are at the forefront of state-of-the art research and technology to unravel biological complexity. They are the world’s future scientists, healers and policy makers. All School of Natural Sciences students, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for the BS degree. The School of Natural Sciences degree requirements are at least 120, but not more than 150 semester units. All courses required for completion of a major (or minor) in Natural Sciences must be passed with a grade of C- or better. Courses taken towards major requirements may only apply to one requirement. Sharing courses between major requirements is not permitted. Majors in the School of Natural Sciences are competitive and space is limited.

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts I would like to welcome you to the UC Merced School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA). Our School is home to many diverse disciplines, programs, students, and faculty. We offer important courses that are the background to a liberal arts education, as well as a range of basic and advanced courses in specific disciplines. Our campus opened-up in 2005, and in a relatively short time, SSHA has grown to be the largest School on campus. Across our 11 departments, we house 15 majors, 19 minors, the Merritt Writing Program, and 7 graduate programs. SSHA provides opportunities for students to explore subjects in depth, while embracing interdisciplinary study and research across the arts, humanities, social and STEM sciences. Indeed, UCM has grown faster than any other UC campus, and has achieved or exceeded the timing of many of the milestones expected for a new university. I encourage you to become a SSHA student and be part of this exciting adventure. I am a firm believer in a solid liberal arts education, no matter what your career trajectory. Having exposure to humanities, arts, and social science, will allow you to think critically and creatively. In addition, SSHA faculty have a long tradition of student-focused teaching and research opportunities. Thus, while we are a UC campus, our smaller size and philosophy towards students provides for student-faculty engagement, student research opportunities, and community connections beyond what you may find in other places. Please explore the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts through our . Let us know if you would like to visit or receive more information about our School. Interim Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, world languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. At Least 120 units to include the following: Students must complete all course prerequisites with a C- or better.

In addition to meeting the transfer admissions requirements described by Undergraduate Admissions, transfer students should complete an acceptable general education course pattern and preparatory courses for the intended major, prior to transfer. Successful completion of general education and major preparation will assure that you do not need to take any additional lower division courses at UC Merced. Students admitted as a first-year applicant may also use IGETC courses to satisfy General Education requirements. Transfer students from a California Community College or first year students who complete the full Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) certification and transfer students from another University of California campus who complete lower division general education requirements, as documented in a Letter of Reciprocity* from that campus, will be considered to have satisfied the below general education requirements at UC Merced. Approaches to Knowledge A: Life and Physical Science (2 courses) Approaches to Knowledge B: Social Science, Literary and Textual Analysis, Media and Visual Analysis, and Societies and Cultures of the Past (3 courses) In addition to satisfying the general education requirements above, Transfer students from a California Community College who complete IGETC certification with Area 7 will also fulfill the Intellectual Experience requirement for Diversity and Identity. *A Letter of Reciprocity is an official document from a UC campus that confirms that a student has satisfied all of the lower-division, general education and University requirements at that campus. California Community College classes articulate to UC Merced general education requirements as explained below. Information on articulation for California’s public colleges and universities may also be found at . These information sources can also provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer. Transfer courses must be completed with at least a C- (or equivalent). UC Merced Lower Division General Education Requirements Waived for students who have completed at least two semesters of full-time college following high school graduation or for first year students who have full IGETC certification IGETC Area 1B: Critical Thinking/English Composition IGETC Area 2A: Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning IGETC Area 6A: Languages Other than English (only for transfers or for first year students who have full IGETC certification) UC Merced Upper Division General Education Requirements *No community college courses can satisfy an upper division requirement. However, for an articulated upper division course from a four-year institution, students can submit a petition for satisfaction of these requirements. UC Merced Approaches to Knowledge General Education Requirements Area B: Societies and Cultures of the Past IGETC Area 4A: Anthropology & Archaeology California Community College courses that are UC Transferable with one of the following C-ID designations: HIST 130, HIST 140, HIST 150, HIST 160, HIST 170, HIST 180, or ANTH 150 UC Merced Intellectual Experience General Education Requirements *Students can submit a petition for satisfaction of the indicated requirements through articulated transfer coursework."

A corequisite course is a course that must be taken at the same time as another course. Prerequisites for courses should be followed carefully; the responsibility for meeting these requirements rests on the student. If you can demonstrate that your preparation is equivalent to that specified by the prerequisites, the instructor may waive these requirements for you. The instructor also may request that a student who has not completed the prerequisites be dropped from the course. If the prerequisite for a course is not satisfied, students must obtain the approval of the instructor (or school designee) of the course they wish to take. For all undergraduate courses a “C-” or better grade is required for a course to be used as a prerequisite for another course. If a course was taken for a “P/NP” grade then a “P” grade is required. For all graduate courses a “B” or better grade is required for a course to be used as a prerequisite for another course. If a course was taken for a “S/U” grade then a “S” grade is required. No credit is allowed for completing a less advanced course after successful completion (C-or better) of a more advanced course in the world languages.

These services are designed to help students not only during their time at UC Merced but also well beyond graduation, ensuring that higher education remains within reach. We administer a range of financial aid programs and scholarships to help cover your educational expenses. Please note that financial aid is not available for students on special or limited enrollment status or for those enrolled in University Extension, except for students in the Teacher Preparation Program. All students, regardless of family income, are encouraged to apply for financial aid. Nearly 90 percent of UC Merced undergraduate students receive some form of assistance. Our financial aid programs aim to remove financial barriers for families who cannot afford the full cost of higher education and to bridge the gap for those who can cover only a portion of it. We consider several factors to determine eligibility, including family income, family size, assets, and your on- or off-campus living arrangements. While most grant awards are based on financial need, some scholarships and loans are available regardless of need. Our bilingual advising team is dedicated to helping you and your family navigate the application process and understand the full range of financial aid opportunities available at UC Merced. We welcome your questions and are here to provide the support and guidance you need throughout your educational journey. If you have questions or need additional information, please contact our Students First Center (SFC) for assistance. For many students, college is the first time they are in control of their own finances. In 2020, we launched UC Merced’s Financial Wellness Center (FWC). The Center provides education and empowerment on money management topics relevant to college life and beyond. This is accomplished through the delivery of digital content, interactive workshops, classroom engagement, special campus events, and personalized financial coaching sessions, as well as working closely with the Basic Needs Office and the Dean of Students. Coaching topics include Personal Budgeting, Bank Accounts, Moving Off-Campus, Paychecks, Insurance, Salary Negotiation, Credit Scores, Homebuying, Investing, Student Loan Repayment, Car Buying, Leases, ID Theft, Retirement, Emergency Savings, Financial Crisis. Students applying for financial aid from UC Merced, the Federal Government and/or the state of California must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the California Dream Act Application (CADAA). The FAFSA or CADAA, as well as the Cal Grant GPA Verification form, should be completed and submitted as soon as possible after October 1st and no later than March 2nd. If the March 2nd priority deadline has already passed, you are encouraged to still apply as a late applicant as some funding may still be available. Apply as soon as possible! We receive and process financial aid applications throughout the academic year. A financial aid advisor is available to assist students and parents with the financial aid application process and can review any special circumstances that may affect aid eligibility. Please contact our SFC for assistance. New students who are citizens or FAFSA-eligible non-citizens: Complete and submit the FAFSA and ensure a verified GPA was submitted to the California Student Aid Commission between October 1st and March 2nd. Note: For incoming freshmen, most high schools electronically send GPA information to the Commission. Complete and return any additional documents requested by the OFAS by June 1st. New students who are not FAFSA-eligible and are AB 540-eligible: Complete and submit the CADAA and ensure a verified GPA was submitted to the California Student Aid Commission by March 2nd (GPA is typically transmitted electronically to the Commission by most high schools for incoming freshman). Complete a UC Merced Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) application if required on your Student Checklist in Connect. Students will be evaluated for AB 540 status as part of the SLR process. Complete and return any additional documents requested by the OFAS by June 1st. Continuing Students who are citizens or FAFSA-eligible non-citizens: Complete and submit the FAFSA between October 1st and March 2nd. Complete and submit a UC Merced Continuing Student Scholarship Application between February 1st and March 2nd. Complete and return any additional documents requested by the OFAS by June 1st. Continuing students who are not FAFSA-eligible and are AB 540-eligible: Complete and submit the CADAA between October 1st and March 2nd. Complete and submit a UC Merced Continuing Student Scholarship Application between February 1st and March 2nd. Complete and return any additional documentation requested by the OFAS by June 1st. Complete either the FAFSA or CADAA for the most recent academic year (e.g., 2024-25 FAFSA for summer 2025), if you haven’t already done so. Comply with any requests for additional information. Students who receive financial aid may receive funds from one or more of the following sources: grants, scholarships loans and work-study. funded by federal and state governments, foundations, corporations, and/or non-profit organizations. Recipients are typically determined based on financial need, or in connection with a research proposal or project, and awards do not have to be repaid. The proceeds of the grants are used to help offset recipients’ cost of education and/or research expenses. The Federal Government provides funds for Pell Grants, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG), and TEACH Grants. The State of California offers Cal Grants (A and B), Middle Class Scholarships (MCS), Chafee Grants, and Golden State Teacher Grants. Additionally, institutional grant funds are provided by the University of California. The Pell Grant program is the largest student grant program administered by the federal government. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, applicants must complete a FAFSA, be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, be enrolled in their initial undergraduate degree program or post-baccalaureate Teacher Preparation program, have demonstrated financial need, are not in default of a federal student loan, and maintain satisfactory academic progress. Lifetime eligibility is limited to 12-semesters / 18-quarters (i.e., 6-years) of full-time equivalent awards. Pell Grant maximum awards for full-time students may change from year to year depending on Congressional appropriations. The award amount depends on your Student Aid Index (SAI) as determined by completing the FAFSA, as well as your enrollment intensity (percentage of full-time enrollment at which a student is enrolled). Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) The SEOG program is a federal campus‐based program designed to supplement other sources of financial aid for undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional financial need based on FAFSA data. As a federal campus‐based program, annual SEOG allocations are provided to individual universities in varying amounts, based on the school’s enrollment data, and may be awarded to students at the school’s discretion within the parameters of federal student aid eligibility guidelines. Therefore, SEOG fund availability, award amounts, and eligibility requirements vary from university to university. Due to our limited allocation, we award this grant to our neediest students first until funds are exhausted. The Cal Grant Program is a state-funded initiative administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) that helps eligible California residents and AB 540 students pay for college or university. Applicants must meet specific eligibility criteria, demonstrate financial need, and adhere to application deadlines. These awards do not need to be repaid. Once awarded, Cal Grants can be renewed for up to three additional years if recipients continue to meet CSAC’s requirements for income, assets, unmet need, enrollment level, academic progress, and filing deadlines. In addition, students enrolled in the Teacher Preparation Program may qualify for a fifth year of funding. awards are based on financial need and academic achievement. This grant covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees. Note: It does not cover campus-based fees. awards are based on financial need and are for entering undergraduate students, primarily from low-income backgrounds. For first-year students, Cal Grant B provides a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. For students in their second through fourth years, it covers UC system-wide tuition and Student Service fees, plus a stipend each semester to assist with living expenses. It is UC Merced’s policy to apply the stipend portion of your Cal Grant B award to fees first. If you would like the stipend to instead be refunded to you, please contact our office. Cal Grant recipients should enroll in at least 15 units per semester, or 30 units per academic year, in order to graduate before their 4-year Cal Grant eligibility is exhausted. Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) provides undergraduate students, including students pursuing a teaching credential, with a scholarship to attend a University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) campus. Students with family income and assets up to $217,000 may be eligible. Award amounts are determined by the California Student Aid Commission and will take into account any federal Pell Grant, Cal Grant, UC Merced Bobcat Grant and scholarships you have been awarded. CSAC administers the Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program through an interagency agreement with the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Program provides eligible California youth aging out of the foster care with financial assistance to attend an eligible postsecondary institution. Students may be eligible to receive up to $5,000 per year. The Chafee Foster Youth Grant Application is available on CSAC’s website. CSAC administers the GSTG Program through an interagency agreement with the California Department of Education (CDE). The GSTG Program provides eligible California residents pursuing a teaching career with financial assistance to enroll in an approved teacher preparation program. Recipients may be eligible to receive up to $10,000 per year. The GSTG Application is available on CSAC’s website. Please note that funding for this program is limited and the availability of the grant may change or be discontinued at any time. The University of California returns a portion of all tuition revenue to financial aid programs. UC Merced uses this funding to provide a need-based institutional grant program called Bobcat Grants to eligible students. Bobcat Grant eligibility is determined using the UC Education Financing Model (EFM) formula approved by the UC Regents for all UC campuses. The UC Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan is a guarantee to students whose family income is below $80,000 per year that they will be awarded enough gift-aid from a combination of federal, state, and/or institutional funds to at least cover their UC systemwide tuition and fees. As part of the UC President’s initiative to create a pathway toward reduced student loan indebtedness, low-income students who meet the eligibility criteria will be awarded additional Bobcat Grant intended to help meet your total cost of attending UC Merced. This additional funding effectively reduces the dollar amount you will be responsible for paying out of pocket while also reducing your need to borrow student loans, thereby creating a potential pathway toward a debt-free UC education. Costs not covered by grants and scholarships could potentially be met by earning wages through part-time work or savings; however, you are still entitled to borrow the maximum student loan amount for which you are eligible. Every student’s circumstances are different, and we encourage you to consult with a Financial Aid Advisor to consider your options. UC students enrolled in a degree program who are California residents and are enrolled in federally recognized Native American, American Indian, and Alaska Native tribes will have their UC systemwide tuition and fees fully covered with gift-aid from federal, state, institutional and/or Tribal funds. Note: Students who are potentially eligible must submit tribal enrollment documentation from their federally recognized tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Contact our office for more information. UC Merced administers various scholarships designed to assist undergraduate students with their educational costs. These scholarships are provided through the generosity of UC alumni, Friends of UC Merced, corporations, businesses, professional associations, and UC Merced. These scholarships include: Merit-Based/Academic Scholarships (i.e., outstanding academic performance, talents, and leadership ability. May include intended area of interest); and, Need-Based Scholarships (i.e., demonstrated financial need from the FAFSA or CADAA. May include academic performance). For new students, one application does it all! All incoming students are automatically considered for institutional scholarships administered by the OFAS simply by submitting a FAFSA or CADAA by March 2nd. New students must have at least a 3.25 GPA to be considered for most scholarships. If the student has been awarded a scholarship by an external entity, they are obligated to report it to us via their UC Merced Connect portal so we can add it to their financial aid award package. Additional external scholarship opportunities are posted on our website at ucmerced.academicworks.com/opportunities/external Continuing students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA as of the end of the prior fall semester to be considered for institutional scholarships. Continuing students must submit a FAFSA or CADAA and a Continuing Student Scholarship Application by March 2nd. Loans are financial aid awards that require repayment with interest. They offer the opportunity to defer the cost of your educational expenses by borrowing now and repaying later. While some loan programs are based on financial need, there are loan programs available to all students regardless of income. Most loan programs available through UC Merced are federally funded, providing long-term, low-interest education loans. Federal Direct Loans are guaranteed, low-interest loans for students. UC Merced participates in the Direct Loan program meaning the loans are processed through the U.S. Department of Education and are funded by the U.S. Treasury. This ensures that the borrower will have a reliable and predictable source of funding. Direct Subsidized Student Loan: The federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. Payments and interest begin six months after the student either graduates or drops below half-time enrollment. Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan: The student is responsible for paying interest while in school but may opt to defer any interest payments until after graduation or ceasing to be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree program. If interest is deferred, it will be capitalized (i.e., added to the loan balance) when repayment begins. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) A Federal PLUS Loan is a low-interest loan for biological or adoptive parents to borrow to help pay the educational expenses for their dependent student. The parent must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen with a good credit history. The dependent student must also be eligible to receive federal financial assistance. Like the Federal Direct Loan, the Department of Education provides funds for the Federal PLUS program. The parent may borrow up to the school’s cost of attendance, minus any aid the student received. Different repayment options are provided by the Department of Education and are designed to provide flexibility in meeting repayment obligations. If the parent-borrower does not qualify for a PLUS Loan, they may either: Obtain an Endorser (i.e., another adult with good credit who is willing to co-sign the loan); or If the parent cannot locate an Endorser, the dependent student may then qualify to borrow additional Unsubsidized loan funds on their own. Students who qualify under the CA Dream Act and graduate from a California high school are eligible for state and university aid; however, they are not eligible for federal aid, including federal loans. The CA DREAM loan program helps close that gap by providing these students with the opportunity to borrow funds to help pay for their education. There is no interest while the student is enrolled at least half-time while working toward a degree, and both payments and interest begin six months after the student graduates or ceases to enroll at least half-time. The State of California requires that students be informed of the following: Federal student loans are available to students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which private education loans are not required to provide. Private loans are funds available to students who are not eligible for financial aid, or they need additional funds to meet their educational expenses. Eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance minus other financial aid or the annual loan maximum amount as determined by the lender. Because private loans are not guaranteed by the federal government, they must be insured privately. This extra cost is passed on to the borrower in the form of higher fees and interest rates. In addition, the lender will look at your credit history as well as other factors to determine if they will lend to you. You may be denied by one lender and approved by another because of the way the lender interprets your information. Students should exhaust all federal student loan eligibility before borrowing private student loans. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program is a federal campus-based program designed to provide eligible students an opportunity to work part-time (i.e., up to 18 hours per week during an academic term), typically on-campus, while earning money to help pay for their educational-related expenses. Jobs are available with flexible schedules that can be adjusted around each student’s classes. Students may only earn up to the amount they are awarded for the year. The advantage of a FWS job over a non-FWS Student Assistant job is that your earnings are not considered in calculating your future aid eligibility. Students are not obligated to accept their FWS award. A student may choose to participate in the program by accepting or declining the work-study award online at UC Merced Connect. All FWS and non-FWS jobs are posted online at UC Merced’s Handshake page. Financial aid programs are subject to myriad federal, state, UC, and institutional regulations that students must meet to qualify and maintain their aid eligibility. These requirements generally include: Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen of the U.S. and complete the FAFSA, OR live in California and meet the requirements for non-resident exemption AB540 status and complete the CA Dream Act Application (CADAA), Be accepted for admission to the University. Be enrolled at least half-time and in good standing at the University. Units taken through University Extension are not counted for financial aid purposes, except for the Teacher Preparation Program. Demonstrate financial need, except for Federal Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS Loans. Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for financial aid, as outlined below. Not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Note: Financial need is the difference between the Cost of Attendance (based on living on-campus, off-campus, or at home) and all available resources, including the Student Aid Index, and any outside aid. Students not enrolled in an approved part-time program are expected to enroll full time at the university. Students not enrolled full time by the 15th day of instruction each semester may have to pay back some of their financial aid. UC Merced confirms academic activity for undergraduate and graduate students each semester. We recalculate financial aid after the 15th day of instruction for all undergraduate and graduate aid recipients based on their enrollment status in those classes which we can confirm that the student began attendance. If we are unable to document the student’s attendance in a class, via the learning management system (i.e., CatCourses) activity or instructor reporting, aid will be adjusted to exclude the units for that class. Student will have an opportunity to appeal if they have supporting documentation confirming their attendance. Generally, financial aid is offered for two semesters each academic year, with an equal amount available each semester to eligible students. The Office of Student Billing Services is responsible for the disbursement and delivery of financial aid. Once all necessary requirements are complete, financial aid funds are disbursed into the student’s university account no sooner than 10 days prior to the first day of classes. All funds are applied to institutional charges first, and any remaining amount will be applied toward authorized charges on the student’s account or refunded to the student or parent, as appropriate. The Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards listed below apply to all aid applicants, whether aid was received for prior coursework. A student’s eligibility for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is affected by this policy. Note: some funds have higher academic and/or enrollment requirements. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, students must meet all three standards: Cumulative GPA, Pace, and Maximum Time Frame. Financial aid applicants must maintain a minimum cumulative University of California grade point average (i.e., average of all terms combined). All financial aid applicants must complete at least 66.7% of all units attempted to keep pace toward graduation. UCM Completed Units + Accepted Transfer Units UCM Attempted Units + Accepted Transfer Units The number of attempted units counted in the formula reflect the units attempted as they appear on the student’s transcript. Units granted for AP and IB coursework are excluded; college level units earned by the student while still enrolled in high school are included. All transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program are included in the pace calculation, both as attempted units as well as completed units. Units for the following grades will not be counted as completed units toward meeting the pace requirement for undergraduate students: F (failure), I (incomplete), NP (not pass), U (unsatisfactory), W (withdraw), NR (no grade reported). The pace calculation includes all completed and attempted units from the academic year’s summer term. If a student repeats a previously passed course, only the first repeat will apply toward the completed unit count; subsequent repeats will not. This does not apply to courses that are repeatable for credit (i.e., independent study courses). Required remedial courses are included in the Pace calculation. All financial aid applicants are allowed up to a certain number of units of financial aid eligibility, including transfer units. Students exceeding the unit limits will be ineligible for financial aid. Example: 180 Units - Transfer Units = Remaining Eligibility for Bachelor Degree Students exceeding the maximum timeframe will be ineligible to receive financial aid. Students will not be granted additional eligibility solely by reason of changing their major or pursuing more than one major or a minor. Every unit attempted as of the Add/Drop period is counted toward the maximum timeframe. Units earned during terms in which the student did not receive aid are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Maximum timeframe measure also includes all the bulleted items under the Pace Requirement section. Units earned during summer terms attended are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Transfer units UC Merced accepts toward a student’s program, up to 70, are counted toward the maximum timeframe. Students pursuing a double-major or second baccalaureate degree will be held to the same standards as all other students. If a student fails to meet any standard, they will be notified that they are ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term the SAP requirements were not met. Because SAP is monitored annually at the end of the spring term, the first term of ineligibility will typically be the following summer or fall term. Eligibility for financial aid will only be reinstated if the student subsequently meets the SAP requirements or if the student successfully appeals. policy is considered ineligible for financial aid. However, UC Merced allows a student to appeal their financial aid ineligibility if they have special circumstances that prevented them from meeting SAP. Special circumstances include but are not limited to significant life events such as the death or illness of a loved one, personal injury or illness, pregnancy, homelessness, loss of childcare or transportation, employment changes, becoming a crime victim, family issues, financial difficulties, changes in academic major, and inability to access support services can impact students Students are encouraged to submit an appeal as soon as they receive notification from the financial aid office. SAP appeals are reviewed within three to four weeks from the time a complete appeal is submitted. A complete SAP Appeal includes a statement explaining special circumstances, a plan for improvement, and supporting documentation. The appeal is available online at and paper copies are available upon request. Instructions for completing the appeal are sent to all students who do not meet the SAP policy. Appeals may be submitted in any term after a student does not meet the SAP policy. Appeals can be submitted online or in person at the Financial Aid Office. Supporting documentation for special circumstances is required. This may include letters from medical providers, degree or academic planning materials from a college advisor, or supporting statements from other on-campus support services such as Student Accessibility Services. UC Merced recognizes that, in some instances, it can be unreasonable or potentially re-traumatizing to produce supporting documentation. A student who cannot reasonably produce documentation should Academic Advisors will create academic plans for all appeal submissions when the student has a cumulative GPA of 1.0 or less or 90+ completed units. The plan ensures that, if followed, the student will maintain sufficient progress toward their degree. Academic plans become part of the Terms and Conditions a student must follow if their appeal is approved. Approval will be based on the student’s circumstances that hindered their academic progress, supporting documentation, and a reasonable expectation that the student can reestablish progress toward a degree objective. If the appeal is approved, the student will be informed via email notifying them to review and accept Terms and Conditions. Financial aid will not disburse until the Terms and Conditions are accepted. Financial aid eligibility is reinstated for one term at a time within the academic year, until the OFAS evaluates SAP for all students at the end of spring. The OFAS monitors adherence to Terms and Conditions at the end of every term and only extends financial aid eligibility to the following term if the Terms and Conditions from the term prior are met. If a student’s appeal is denied, they will be informed via email notifying them of their option to request a second review by a reviewer who did not participate in the initial review. Requests for a second review for a denied appeal must be submitted in writing. Students withdrawing from UC Merced during a semester or for a future semester must file an Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar. When a student withdraws from UC Merced, the withdrawal date used to calculate the amount of financial aid that needs to be returned is the latest of the following: The date when student files the Official Notice of University Cancellation/Withdrawal Form with the University Registrar, or The date when the student officially notifies the Registrar’s Office of their intent to withdraw; or UC Merced determines what most accurately reflects the last date of an academically related activity of the student. Students who enroll in the Educational Leave Program are subject to the same guidelines as those listed above for students who withdraw from UC Merced. If the student leaves without beginning UC Merced’s official withdrawal process or otherwise providing official notification of their intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date for the return of federal funds will be the 50% point in the term. In this instance, UC Merced could determine an earlier withdrawal date if circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., illness) prevented them from beginning the official withdrawal process. UC Merced could also determine the last date of an academically related activity of the student. The date used to determine the return of federal funds may be different than the date used by UC Merced to determine institutional refunds. IMPORTANT WARNING: The duration of your financial aid eligibility is limited. When you withdraw or take an educational leave for a term after aid is disbursed you use one semester of eligibility!"

The University will refuse to accept a personal check from a student who is a repeat offender. Any student who has more than two non-sufficient funds checks returned to the University is placed on a cash-only basis for one year (i.e. cash, cashier’s check, money order, or online credit card payment). Cancellation, Withdrawal and Fee Reversals To cancel registration before the first day of instruction or to withdraw from the University on or after the first day of instruction, you must complete a Cancellation/Withdrawal form and return the form to the Students First Center. If you do not submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form, you will be liable for fees according to University policy. It is very important that you contact the Students First Center and initiate withdrawal/leave of absence procedures even if your fees are fully paid by financial aid or other programs. Failing to do so may result in you owing money to the University. The effective date for determining a fee reversal is the date a Leaving UC Merced form is submitted. The percentage of fees that may be reversed is determined by the number of calendar days (not instruction days) elapsed, beginning with the first day of instruction for the semester. Failure to submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form: If you are not a financial aid recipient and you fail to submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form, you will be presumed to have attended school the entire semester and full fees will be due. If you are a financial aid recipient, you must contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships for information on how this will affect you. More information about withdrawing and financial aid can be found here: The $250 deposit paid with the Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) is not refundable. Any full or partial reversal of housing charges is made in accordance with the housing contract. Please refer to your contract for information related to contract cancellation. New Students Who Receive Title IV Federal Financial Assistance and Withdraw During their First Academic Term: Federal regulations require UC Merced to calculate the amount of federal financial aid that has been “earned” for all students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UC Merced during a semester. If the student withdraws prior to completing 60 percent of the semester, a pro-rated portion of the aid must be returned to the funding agency. The student’s account will be billed for any aid returned. All students will be assessed the student health insurance fee. Students who cancel all course registration on or before the first day of instruction are entitled to a full reversal of this fee. Insurance fees will not be reversed after the first day of instruction and coverage remains in effect until the date specified by the insurance plan. Charges other than the student services fee, tuition, nonresident supplemental tuition and campus-based fees are reversed according to guidelines and schedules published by the appropriate department."

If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and environmental systems science are the links to making discoveries about the natural world, the impact of human activities on that world and the impact of that world on human health. The academic programs in the School of Natural Sciences are designed to help students learn fundamental scientific principles in the context of the real world. Discovery consists in seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what no one else has thought. Answering questions requires creativity and innovation— creativity to think about a problem in a different way; to design the strategy to, for example, discover the gene(s) responsible for asthma, cancer or cardiovascular disease; to generate ideas for new technologies. Students in the School of Natural Sciences receive the foundational learning to create innovative technologies to solve problems and implement solutions. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. Understanding and prediction must precede protection. Students in the School of Natural Sciences fully understand the complex interactions between the physical and biological world and the consequences of society’s actions on the Earth and its biota. With this understanding, they are well positioned to manage and preserve our resources for future generations. Louis Pasteur’s theory of germs is ridiculous fiction. The understanding of science has improved and will continue to improve. Health and disease, prevention and treatment rely on understanding complex systems. Students in Natural Sciences at UC Merced are at the forefront of state-of-the art research and technology to unravel biological complexity. They are the world’s future scientists, healers and policy makers. All School of Natural Sciences students, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for the BS degree. The School of Natural Sciences degree requirements are at least 120, but not more than 150 semester units. All courses required for completion of a major (or minor) in Natural Sciences must be passed with a grade of C- or better. Courses taken towards major requirements may only apply to one requirement. Sharing courses between major requirements is not permitted. Majors in the School of Natural Sciences are competitive and space is limited. Students must make appropriate degree progress to remain in any Natural Sciences major. Students in the Natural Sciences must meet the following requirements to continue in the School: All students must pass the following courses with a C- or better, prior to the start of the third regular (Fall/Spring) semester.

Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Dear Future Leaders, Creators, and Innovators: The world needs creative minds and problem-solvers—people who are ready to challenge ideas and inspire change for the better. At UC Merced’s School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA), you will find the knowledge, skills, and opportunities to turn your ambitions into action. SSHA is home to a diverse range of majors that empower students to explore topics such as human behavior, artistic expression, political mobilization, and artificial intelligence. Whether you are drawn to understanding societies, advocating for change, telling compelling stories, or analyzing the forces that shape our world, our programs will help you develop the critical thinking skills needed to succeed in any career. SSHA graduates go on to work in a wide array of fields, including business, government, education, and nonprofits, or pursue advanced degrees in law, public policy, and the arts. As the largest school at UC Merced, SSHA offers hands-on learning, close faculty mentorship, and opportunities to engage in research and community projects. Here, you will join a dynamic academic environment that values curiosity, creativity, and collaboration—one that encourages you to ask big questions and seek meaningful solutions. Your journey starts now. Explore our programs, connect with our faculty, and discover how a SSHA major can prepare you for a future of impact. We look forward to welcoming you to our vibrant community. Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and establishing models of decision‐making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is evolved. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student‐led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, world languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, public health, sociology, world heritage and writing that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. At Least 120 units to include the following: Students must complete all course prerequisites with a C- or better. When a letter grade option is available for a major requirement, students must complete that requirement with a C‐ or better; a 2.0 GPA must be maintained in all major course work.

Learn more here: admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/exam-requirement/ HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR GRADE-POINT AVERAGE The grade-point average (GPA) used in the University’s admissions process is calculated by using grades earned in all college preparatory courses (“a-g” subjects), taken between the summer after ninth grade through the summer before 12th grade. To calculate your admission GPA, first convert the grades you earned in your courses to a four-point scale as follows: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point and F=0 points. Only the grades you earn in “a-g” subjects taken after ninth grade and before 12th grade will be used to calculate your preliminary GPA for admissions. Courses you take in ninth grade can be used to meet the subject requirements if you earned grades of C or better, but they will be excluded from the calculation of your admissions GPA. Add all your grade points and divide by the number of “a-g” courses. The result is your preliminary admissions GPA. It is important for you to earn good grades in the “a-g” courses you list on the application for your senior year. The admissions offer may be withdrawn if you drop courses or earn grades of D or F during 12th grade. The University assigns extra points for up to 4 units of certified honors-level courses. Honors courses are Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate Higher Level and designated Standard Level courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school’s course list. Courses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; courses in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade. No more than two units of certified honors-level courses taken in grade 10 can be assigned extra points. D grades are not assigned extra points. Students who receive D or F grades in “a-g” courses must repeat those courses with grades of C or better. In the subject areas of mathematics and foreign language, however, a D or F grade can be “validated” by earning a C grade or better in the second semester or a more advanced level in the same subject. The omission of a yearlong course in Geometry cannot be validated by a more advanced level math course. For more information about meeting and validating the Geometry requirement, please see page 20 in the Quick Reference Guide to UC Admissions at admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/_files/documents/quick-reference.pdf . Consult the Office of Admissions or your counselor to determine how D or F grades can be improved and how the University will use them in evaluating your scholarship record. Grades will not be used for repeated courses in which you initially received a C or better. Domestic Nonresident and International First Year Applicants Applicants from other states in the U.S. and international first year applicants must meet subject and examination requirements as described above; however, your grade-point average in the “a-g” subjects must be very good – at the level of approximately 3.40 or higher. International students whose native language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency by one of the following methods: Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and earn a minimum score of 80 on the internet-based TOEFL. For more information visit Take the International English Language Testing System exam (IELTS) and earn a minimum score of 6.5. For more information visit Take the Duolingo English Test (DET) and earn a minimum score of 115 or better. For more information visit All applicants will be considered for admission on the basis of their academic achievements within the context of their school and home or social environments. The following factors can be considered in a comprehensive review of applicants for admission to UC Merced as a first year: Academic grade point average in all completed A-G courses, including additional points for completed UC-certified honors courses.

Location of your secondary school and residence. If you enrolled in a regular session of college- or university-level coursework after leaving high school, you are considered to be a transfer student and cannot ignore your college records to apply as a first year. UC Merced is firmly committed to enrolling well-prepared transfer students. Following California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC Merced gives highest priority to students transferring from California’s community colleges who have completed at least 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units). To be considered for admission to UC Merced as a transfer student, you must fulfill either the junior-level or lower division transfer requirements. In addition, you will be required to complete the preparation requirements for your intended major. It is helpful if you identify an intended major early and take all preparatory courses for that major before you transfer. Information about UC Merced majors and transfer preparation is available at admissions.ucmerced.edu/transfer/major-preparation-schools If you are enrolled at a California Community College, you should visit for courses that have been articulated to meet lower-division preparatory requirements and general education for your chosen major. The Importance of Preparing for Your Major Transfer students who complete freshman and sophomore-level courses for their intended majors before they transfer enjoy a smooth transition to UC Merced. Depth of preparation is a critical factor in the admission decision. Students transferring at the junior level complete approved major preparation courses and demonstrate readiness for study in their chosen major. In addition, you must satisfy English composition and mathematics courses required for eligibility to enroll as a transfer student at the University of California. The University awards transfer unit credit for courses taken at U.S. regionally accredited institutions and determined by the Office of Admissions to be essentially the same as those offered for the undergraduate degree at any UC campus. For more detail, see the Transfer Credit Practices Section of this catalog. Transferable courses offered by California Community Colleges are listed on the UC Transferable Courses section of the California public institution articulation database, found at Grade points for all UC-transferable courses attempted on a letter-grade basis will be computed into the grade-point average (GPA) used to determine admission. Units for courses in which you earned grades of AR, EW, W, Pass or Credit, and No Pass or No Credit, are excluded from the computation of your GPA. Generally, the grading system used at the institution you are attending will be used in determining your admission GPA; however, grades for honors courses taken in college are not weighted when computing the GPA for admission. If you have attended only community colleges or two-year postsecondary institutions, all of your UC-transferable college courses will be accepted in transfer for subject credit, and your GPA for admission is computed using all UC-transferable college courses attempted. When you transfer, however, the total number of units that can be used toward your UC degree is limited to a maximum total of 70 semester units (105 quarter units). Students transferring to UC Merced from a regionally accredited four-year college or university can have up to 79 transferable semester (118 quarter) units and still be eligible to transfer without a dean’s review. Applicants with 80 semester (120 quarter) units or more; a dean’s review is required. Transfer Credit Policy for University of California, Merced, Effective Fall 2018 The University of California, Merced, grants unit credit for college courses completed at United States colleges and universities accredited by the seven formerly regional accrediting agencies; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Courses determined to be essentially the same as courses offered for an undergraduate degree at any UC campus will be granted credit, if the course: Is listed in the original institution’s catalog/website of official courses offered for the year in which the course was completed, and Includes the same or similar content, and Requires the same or similar prerequisite coursework, and Is offered at the same level of instruction. Courses that further the student’s knowledge and understanding in fundamental liberal arts disciplines such as mathematics, natural science, literature, social sciences, fine arts and philosophy are acceptable for transfer if comparable in scope and depth to those offered at the UC. Courses accepted for transfer must be reported on an official transcript (academic record), which must be provided to UC Merced in a sealed envelope from the original college/university of enrollment, bearing the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. UC does not award credit posted to a third-party institution’s transcript. Credit is only considered from the original institution’s official academic record. work or volunteer experience, vocational or technical training, and personal enrichment courses; remedial academic or pre-baccalaureate courses, especially in English and mathematics; or College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) exams. Courses completed at unaccredited/non-regionally accredited institutions may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. UC Merced can award lower-division (freshman/sophomore level) units for military courses completed if the courses are consistent with the University policy on granting transfer credit when there is an equivalent course taught at a UC campus. UC Merced will consult the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations for information regarding course content as a guide to the awarding of credit. Courses from enrollment at another UC main campus (not UC Extension) during a regular academic (fall, winter, spring) or summer term are all transferable. Courses from enrollment at any UC Extension division are transferable if the course is numbered X1- X199; courses numbered 1-199 which include a campus designation (e.g. XB, XLA) are equivalent to the same course offered to undergraduates on that campus. Students will be granted up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any other institution or any combination of other institutions. For units beyond the maximum allowed, subject credit for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation will be granted and can be used to satisfy requirements. Units earned through AP, IB and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. Units earned at any UC campus (Extension, summer, cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. Note: if all courses are completed at one or more 2-year (community) colleges, a student would never be in danger of having too many (excessive) units. In addition, there is a limit to the number of units for which UC Merced grants credit in the following areas: English as a Second Language courses: Maximum 8 semester/12 quarter units Physical Education activity courses: Maximum 4 semester/6 quarter units. A maximum of 8 semester/12 quarter units of PE Theory UC Merced will not grant credit for college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously completed course, or examination for which credit has already been granted, with the exception of the repeat of deficient (C-/D/F) course grades. UC Merced grants credit for examinations as follows: International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level GCE or Hong Kong Advanced Level (A-Levels) – unit credit could be granted for satisfactory grades and scores. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST) exams. Every California Community College has an agreement with the UC – a Transfer Course Agreement (TCA). The TCA specifies which courses receive UC credit. To learn if college courses from a California Community College are transferable to UC Merced, visit . These lists are updated throughout the year, so check ASSIST periodically to ensure you have the most current information. Other two-year and four-year Institutions: The UC does not have transfer course agreements with institutions other than the California Community Colleges. However, using ASSIST and/or referring to any UC campus’ general catalog can provide guidance on the likelihood that courses from other institutions would transfer to UC Merced. UC Merced does not grant credit for junior/community college programs that are technical or vocational, or programs that do not lead to further academic study at a university in the international country. Elementary/intermediate language courses: No credit is granted to students who were instructed in that language during secondary school. Final determination on the transferability of coursework for credit will be made by UC Merced’s Office of Admissions, based on UC Merced’s review (not that of another institution).

A corequisite course is a course that must be taken at the same time as another course. Prerequisites for courses should be followed carefully; the responsibility for meeting these requirements rests on the student. If you can demonstrate that your preparation is equivalent to that specified by the prerequisites, the instructor may waive these requirements for you. The instructor also may request that a student who has not completed the prerequisites be dropped from the course. If the prerequisite for a course is not satisfied, students must obtain the approval of the instructor (or school designee) of the course they wish to take. For all undergraduate courses a “C-” or better grade is required for a course to be used as a prerequisite for another course. If a course was taken for a “P/NP” grade then a “P” grade is required. For all graduate courses a “B” or better grade is required for a course to be used as a prerequisite for another course. If a course was taken for a “S/U” grade then a “S” grade is required. No credit is allowed for completing a less advanced course after successful completion (C-or better) of a more advanced course in the world languages.

During the past 40 years, this synergy between biology and engineering has led to a wide range of implantable materials, diagnostic devices, sensors and molecular characterization techniques, and it has produced tools that greatly expedited the sequencing of the human genome. Along with these practical innovations has come a rapidly increasing need for personnel with the necessary interdisciplinary skills, and undergraduate bioengineering programs have proliferated alongside the continued growth of bioengineering research. The undergraduate major in Bioengineering is designed to provide students with both breadth and depth, and the possibility of a focus on nanobioengineering, tissue engineering, or physiological engineering. It is suitable preparation for individuals seeking a career in research or industry, or pursuing advanced degrees such as Ph.D. or M.D."
https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=2&ent_oid=42,Materials Science and Engineering Major - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™,"Materials Science and Engineering Major - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™ School of Social Sciences, Humanities & Arts Ernest and Julio Gallo Management Program Office of Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Physical Operations, Planning and Development UC Merced students majoring in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) will be equipped for leadership in a field that dictates the pace of technological progress. Since the beginnings of civilization, technological progress has always relied on the materials people were able to acquire from nature, through trade or by innovation. Wood, stone, bronze, iron, steel, aluminum, cements, plastics, semiconductors, liquid crystals, nanomaterials and quantum dots all have unique properties that enable—but also limit—what humans can make and do. Nations continue to go to war over access to particular raw materials. The construction of safe dwellings, the conveniences of rapid travel, the efficiency of telecommunications, the calculating and archiving power of computers, the life prolonging gifts of surgical implants and the dazzling performances of athletes all require dependable materials. Future technological progress, of any kind, will always be driven by the available materials. Materials Science and Engineering applies fundamental principles of physics and chemistry to designing materials with desired combinations of mechanical, optical, electrical, magnetic, electrochemical and other properties. Increasingly, innovative materials are being developed with the benefit of lessons that have been learned from nature. Examples include armor based on the structure of abalone shells and rats’ teeth; optical materials that owe a debt to sea urchin spines and peacock feathers; high-performance ballistic fibers modeled on spider silk; self-cleaning surfaces copied from lotus leaves; and strong, reusable adhesives that emulate the behavior of gecko feet. Also encompassed in MSE are the methods by which particular atomic and molecular arrangements (nanostructures and microstructures) are achieved, the overall cost of the ingredients and processes used to produce particular materials, the effects of the environment on materials, the effects of materials and materials processing on the environment, and characterization of materials structure and properties. Because MSE embraces skills from physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology, it is especially appealing to anyone who enjoys interdisciplinary studies and who seeks to apply such knowledge to solving practical engineering problems. MSE graduates are in demand in a great variety of fields including manufacturing, energy, utilities, patent law, the financial sector, construction, transportation, aerospace, computer industries, sports, consulting, public policy, education and research. Employers appreciate the ability of MSE graduates to relate to colleagues across a broad spectrum of expertise. Recent surveys of employment prospects nationally point to a steady growth in the overall MSE job market over the next decade, at least. The growth will likely be focused in areas related to the development of new materials, including materials for nanotechnology and biotechnology, rather than traditional areas of materials manufacturing. The MSE major at UC Merced reflects this expectation, with an emphasis on materials issues that will ensure the long-term relevance of our MSE degree."

The program is also a good foundation for further study in Earth science, engineering, business, management, law and public health. The curriculum provides students with a quantitative understanding of the physical, chemical and biological principles that control air, water and habitat quality and sustainability on Earth, along with expertise in the design, development, implementation and assessment of engineering solutions to environmental problems. Environmental engineers are distinguished from other environmental professionals through their focus on problem solving, design, and implementation of technological or management systems. Environmental engineers search for creative and economical ways to use resources efficiently, limit the release of residuals into the environment, develop sensitive techniques to track pollutants once released and find effective methods to remediate spoiled resources. They serve as the vital link between scientific discovery, technological development and the societal need for protecting human health and ecological integrity. In the coming decades, environmental engineers will increasingly be called upon to address broader issues of environmental sustainability by minimizing the release of residuals through altered production processes and choice of materials; by capturing the resource value of wastes through recovery, recycling and reuse; and by managing natural resources to meet competing societal objectives. UC Merced emphasizes a highly interdisciplinary approach to environmental engineering, combining a strong theoretical foundation with field studies, laboratory experiments and computations. Core courses within the major provide students with a firm foundation in the physical and life sciences and the ways that they apply to energy, hydrology, and air- and water-quality issues. Emphasis areas allow students the flexibility to study in more depth by following tracks developed in consultation with their academic adviser(s). The main areas of emphasis for Environmental Engineering at UC Merced are hydrology, water quality, air pollution and sustainable energy. Hydrology focuses on the sources, balance and use of water in both natural and managed environments, including precipitation, mountain snowpack, river runoff, vegetation, water use and groundwater. Both the physical and chemical aspects of the water cycle are included. Water quality focuses on engineering solutions to water and waste issues, including measurement technology, water-quality assessments, treatment systems and remediation of contaminated waters. Physical, chemical and biological aspects are included. Air pollution and sustainable energy focus on engineering solutions to air quality and energy problems, both regionally and globally. The sources, fate, effects of air pollutants, as well as the planning and design of solar and other renewable energy systems are included. Engineers need to understand not only the technical but also the social and political contexts of their work. They must be able to communicate and plan, finance and market their products and ideas. Social sciences, business, humanities and arts courses are an important part of the curriculum. The result is a major that is hands-on and creative, engaging and adaptable."

Science, technology and innovation are the keys to future prosperity and quality of life. The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Following Majors: The School of Natural Sciences Offers the Science and mathematics have become increasingly important in today’s world as we attempt to find new solutions to help society solve important problems in energy, the environment, sustainability, and human health. All of these problems will require novel and creative approaches that depend heavily on interdisciplinary and diverse teams of scientists. A degree in the sciences will open the door to many careers, where you will be able to apply your knowledge to help develop solutions that could have a far-reaching global impact. The UC Merced Natural Sciences faculty is committed to educating and training a new generation of scientists through the use of the latest theoretical, experimental, and computational technologies. Our graduates develop both the practical skills necessary to immediately start at a high-tech company as well as the fundamental scientific skills to pursue professional schools and graduate programs. We welcome you to Merced and invite you to visit any of our faculty members to talk about the many exciting opportunities for you in the School of Natural Sciences and beyond. The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible. The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and Earth systems science are the links to making discoveries about the natural world, the impact of human activities on that world and the impact of that world on human health. The academic programs in the School of Natural Sciences are designed to help students learn fundamental scientific principles in the context of the real world. Discovery consists in seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what no one else has thought. Answering questions requires creativity and innovation— creativity to think about a problem in a different way; to design the strategy to, for example, discover the gene(s) responsible for asthma, cancer or cardiovascular disease; to generate ideas for new technologies. Students in the School of Natural Sciences receive the foundational learning to create innovative technologies to solve problems and implement solutions. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. Understanding and prediction must precede protection. Students in the School of Natural Sciences fully understand the complex interactions between the physical and biological world and the consequences of society’s actions on the Earth and its biota. With this understanding, they are well positioned to manage and preserve our resources for future generations. Louis Pasteur’s theory of germs is ridiculous fiction. The understanding of science has improved and will continue to improve. Health and disease, prevention and treatment rely on understanding complex systems. Students in Natural Sciences at UC Merced are at the forefront of state-of-the art research and technology to unravel biological complexity. They are the world’s future scientists, healers and policy makers. All School of Natural Sciences students, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for the BS degree.

The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Offers the Following Majors: The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Offers the Following Programs: Welcome from the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts In 1962, Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian professor of English literature, coined the term “global village,” which meant to him a future in which communication across cultures and across the world could be instantaneous. Today, his vision has been made into a reality by the Internet, one that allows us to be in Merced and Kathmandu at the same virtual moment. But merely being able to communicate does not erase the reality of cultural and linguistic diversity—to truly and effectively communicate, one must also understand the social, political, economic, aesthetic, and religious variability that characterizes the world in which we live. In other words, to be a true global citizen, one must have the ability to think critically, write well, have knowledge of the past so as to inform the present, and to develop a capacity for life-long learning. To help you become this global citizen, our school embraces many disciplines, including cognitive and information sciences, humanities and world cultures, psychological sciences, and social sciences and management. Our faculty are among the very best scholars in the world and they have joined UC Merced to create exciting new programs that appeal to our leaders of the future. Although we offer traditional majors and minors, we also seek to broaden your horizons by offering courses of multidisciplinary studies—ones that cross-cut traditional fields. In some classes, you will learn the basics—the fundamental knowledge of a discipline, and how that knowledge can be used to get a better understanding of the complexity of the human condition. In other classes, you will be challenged to develop critical thinking skills that can be used in any career no matter what the content. And in many of our courses, you will learn how to write effectively, collaborate with your peers, and speak in public settings, both large and small. When you leave UC Merced, you will be equipped with the knowledge and skill sets that will enable you to engage with the world, to recognize and solve problems of all kinds, and to succeed in a career. Take advantage of the limitless opportunities you have before you in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts. Become that global citizen! Dean, School of Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts Our educational philosophy can be captured by the following principles which guide the way that the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts constructs a learning foundation for our students: Students are encouraged to create the forms they are studying—whether they are plays, maps, persuasive essays or social surveys. We believe that developing writing skills leads to critical reading; being an articulate speaker leads to becoming a better listener; and developing models of decision-making from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective leads to a better appreciation of how policy is developed. We invite students to participate in the research programs of our faculty, to create student-led teams and to embark on individual, mentored research projects. Through their research, students learn to evaluate and use evidence and construct persuasive arguments based upon actual events and previous experience. Some of the best learning occurs outside of the classroom around peers and in communities. Diverse learning environments allow students to make connections between books and the world. Human beings are natural learners, and our job as educators is to provide an environment where students can engage these natural instincts. Courses are the anchors, but a lot of exciting learning depends upon students’ own discovery of the links between formal academic programs and other endeavors such as foreign travel, artistic performance, political or business internship or community service. When we develop an informed and critical engagement with our own community, we can make better sense of what is happening there, and we can begin to see how our home is related to the globe. We live in a world where we are globally interdependent. Political borders, which change over time, determine citizenship and affect life opportunities. Ideas, diseases, languages, goods and individuals have always moved around the region and the world, but they do not reach all destinations with equal ease; they do not have equivalent effects when they alight in different places; and they are transformed by their new environments. We envision our community of students as developing a zone of comfort that allows them to act simultaneously as local and global citizens. As a new campus, UC Merced has the singular opportunity to foster an integrative environment that draws from these disciplinary research traditions, but is not limited by their boundaries. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, English, foreign languages, history, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, sociology and world heritage that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures. School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Requirements All students in the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, regardless of major, are expected to meet the minimum requirements for a degree. The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts degree requirements are: At least 120 units to include the following: At least 44 semester units of general education courses.

It combines methods, theories, and applications from many disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, and biology. The Cognitive Science majors, B.A. and B.S., provide a broad knowledge of cognitive science, including language and communication, reasoning, memory, categorization, cognitive modeling, perception and action, philosophical foundations, artificial intelligence, cognitive engineering, and cognitive science applications for the business setting. A degree in Cognitive Science provides in-depth training in research methods, data analysis, modeling, and lab-based research, and it provides excellent training for jobs in high-tech companies. It is ideal for students who want to pursue graduate work in cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, computer science and engineering, information sciences and information management, communications, medicine, business, management, law, and education. Students can work with cognitive science faculty to tailor their own program of study to emphasize one or two specific areas within cognitive science. Example specializations include cognitive neuroscience, cognitive linguistics, computational modeling, decision sciences, and philosophy of cognitive science."
https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=2&ent_oid=46,Anthropology Major - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™,"Anthropology Major - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™ School of Social Sciences, Humanities & Arts Ernest and Julio Gallo Management Program Office of Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Physical Operations, Planning and Development Anthropology is dedicated to understanding humankind’s diversity as well as what makes us uniquely human. Through the specific perspectives and methods of socio-cultural, archaeological, and biological anthropology, students learn how the human experience (past and present) is constituted through the interaction of social, cultural, political, material, historical, environmental, and biological factors. Anthropology strives for a holistic understanding of humankind and, depending on the questions asked and the means used to discover answers, anthropological knowledge can straddle the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences. The undergraduate major in Anthropology emphasizes how topics and issues central to the human experience such as migration, gender, power, health, kinship, race and identity are examined and understood through diverse anthropological methodologies. In upper division courses, students explore particular socio-cultural, archaeological and biological perspectives on such issues in greater depth, and these courses may specifically engage perspectives from two or more sub-fields. Other courses may consider a range of topics within a specific geographical area, while acknowledging certain limitations to the area studies configuration of knowledge. Undergraduate majors in Anthropology develop critical skills in thought, written and oral expression and the application of knowledge, as well as a valuable understanding of human cultural diversity. In an increasingly globalized world in which interaction with people of diverse cultures is becoming the norm, developing a cross-cultural understanding about the complexities of human societies past and present is what makes Anthropology an ideal education for the 21st century. A bachelor’s degree in Anthropology is valuable preparation for a career in law, medicine, education, business, government, museums, and various areas of non-profit, public and international service, including public policy and cultural resource management. The Anthropology program also provides a strong foundation for graduate study in any sub-field of anthropology. By offering undergraduate majors opportunities to work with faculty research and apply knowledge and skills to local communities, agencies, and business through service learning and internships, students are further prepared for advanced study and successful careers."
https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=2&ent_oid=48,Economics Major - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™,"Economics Major - University of California Merced - Modern Campus Catalog™ School of Social Sciences, Humanities & Arts Ernest and Julio Gallo Management Program Office of Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Physical Operations, Planning and Development Economists study how scarce resources are allocated so that the well-being of individuals is maximized. Whether the resource that is being allocated is income, time, or a precious commodity, there is always some tradeoff associated with allocating the resource for one use and not another. Individuals, businesses, and governments face these tradeoffs in countless ways every day. The most important thing students learn from studying economics is how to identify, measure, and understand the essential elements of this tradeoff. The Economics major is built on a foundation of strong theoretical and statistical training. The major provides students solid grounding in microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, statistical and econometric methodology, as well as applied economic analysis. The Economics major emphasizes the role of incentives and institutions in shaping economic outcomes and how public policies influence economic performance and individual outcomes. Special emphases in the program include labor economics, public economics, political economy, law and economics, environmental economics, empirical methods, and U.S. economic history. In addition to having a solid understanding of economic theory, our program has a special emphasis on empirical research methods in economics. All students engage in research (with faculty, in teams, and independently) that involves analyzing data and answering well formulated questions related to public policies. With these research experiences, our students are competitive for research internships, fellowships, and pre-graduate summer programs while still in school. Because students with a degree in economics develop strong analytical and quantitative skills and the ability to solve complex problems effectively, studying economics is excellent preparation for many careers in business, law, management consulting, education, or public service. Businesses of all types and sizes, financial institutions, consulting firms, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, as well as graduate business and law schools actively seek graduates with bachelor’s degrees in economics. In addition, many of our students go on to do graduate study in economics, law, public policy, or business."

We cannot hope to address America’s contemporary racial dilemmas without understanding the history of slavery and Manifest Destiny. Nor can we grasp today’s global patterns of poverty and prosperity without grappling with the history of empire and the spread of capitalism. The long history of immigration that has made California’s Central Valley such a diverse region is intertwined with both global and national histories of war, revolution, commerce, culture, and politics. Though rooted in the study of the past, the tools employed by historians are useful in a broad array of modern careers and professions. History, with its focus on research, writing, and argumentation, is well known as an excellent preparation for graduate school, law school, and other professions. History majors may also find employment related to their degrees in schools, museums, editing and publishing, archives, historic preservation, federal, state and local agencies, and as consultants and contractors. History majors at UC Merced choose a field of concentration in either United States History or World History. They apply their classroom learning to research problems outside the classroom, where they can contribute to expanding public knowledge and awareness of cultural issues. Students may explore thematic topics such as environmental history, the history of science and technology, the history of migration and cultural intersections, as well as issues of world, national, state and local history. Current UC Merced faculty members’ areas of expertise include archives and museums, the study of global conflict and diplomacy, American history, world history, political geography, and the digital mapping of historical and cultural phenomena.

UC Merced’s Management major provides rigorous analytical and quantitative training from a blend of fields including accounting, finance, management, marketing, information systems, operations, economics and other social sciences. Real-life management problems do not fit neatly into subject areas. Today’s managers tackle issues that involve a number of management functions—so solutions need to draw on expertise from a variety of different areas. The UC Merced approach is to step away from thinking of management as a set of separate functions drawing from single disciplines. Instead, students learn to integrate key ideas from across subject areas to understand all the dimensions of a given issue. Creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship are emphasized. The major is based on the premise that organizations require employees who are trained in analytical and quantitative decision-making, who work effectively in teams and on projects, who are comfortable in various cultures, who are “well rounded” in sciences and humanities, and who have learned the art of self-directed learning. The Management major prepares students for a broad range of management-related careers. Students will learn the analytical tools that are needed to succeed in a modern, volatile business environment. The curriculum provides a strong foundation on analysis and problem solving across a wide spectrum of management activities. The theoretical underpinning for the undergraduate program comes from economics and management science disciplines that use tools and techniques based on applied mathematics and statistics to solve problems in virtually all areas of business operations. The typical undergraduate student develops skills to build quantitative models of complex operations in competitive and in imperfect markets and be able to use these models to facilitate decision-making."

The study of political institutions includes topics such as the effect of the design of electoral systems on the quality of representation in government, the formal and informal elements of the legislative process and their implications for the making of law, and the impact of domestic political institutions on the incidence of international conflict. Under the rubric of political behavior, political scientists study how and why people choose to participate in politics, the determinants of vote choice, and the nature and origins of public opinion. Students studying political science at UC Merced develop a strong substantive understanding of both political institutions and behavior. Students also learn the theories that help us better understand the political world and the methods by which these theories are tested and refined. Political Science majors choose courses from three subfields of the discipline: American Politics, Comparative Politics, and International Relations. The study of institutions and behavior is central to all three of these subfields, although the substantive emphasis differs. Courses in American Politics focus on domestic politics in the U.S., while courses in Comparative Politics examine government and politics in other nations. International Relations classes address issues in foreign policy, international conflict, and the institutions intended to govern the interactions between nations. Students focus on one of these three subfields, although they also are required to take courses in one or both subfields outside of their focus. The knowledge and skills acquired with the Political Science Major should provide a strong foundation for graduate training in law, political science or other social sciences. Students graduating with a degree in political science can also pursue a wide variety of other careers, such as public administration, campaign management or consultation, grassroots political organization, corporate governmental affairs, Foreign Service, journalism, lobbying or teaching."

The field of psychology can be both applied and theoretical, and is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing together aspects of the natural and social sciences, humanities and the arts to address specific problems. For example, research psychologists might study the biology of the brain, complex mathematical processes, how to collect and analyze data, the growth of children, health and behavioral physiology, learning in animals, psychological stress, the basis of artistic talent, evolution, sensory perception, parent-infant attachment, psychiatric disorders or any of a wide variety of other topics. The undergraduate major in Psychology provides students with an understanding of the major questions and methodologies across Psychology, including a common core of statistical and experimental methods courses. Upper division courses and projects allow students to explore the various substantive specialties in psychology, and to identify the areas of psychology that they might wish to pursue further. Many students with an undergraduate degree in psychology go on to graduate study in psychology or closely related fields such as cognitive science or organizational behavior. The psychology program strongly encourages further graduate study, and supports its undergraduate majors in reaching this goal by providing opportunities to work with faculty on research. The Psychology major also prepares undergraduates for many other careers even without further graduate training. The American Psychological Association reports that only about 5% of 1997 and 1998 bachelor’s degree psychology major graduates had taken a job that is actually in psychology. Most psychology major graduates—about two thirds—took employment in private sector business settings. Graduates with an undergraduate psychology major are highly marketable because they are trained to have good research and writing skills, to be effective problem solvers in both team and individual settings, and to use critical thinking skills to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information. Specific examples of employment include administrative support, public affairs, education, business, sales, service industries, health, the biological sciences, computer programming, employment counselors, correction counselor trainees, interviewers, personnel analysts, probation officers, and writers. The same APA report finds that two thirds of psychology major graduates believe their job is closely or somewhat related to their psychology background and that their jobs hold career potential."

A key contribution of the discipline is that social factors matter; our lives are not only shaped by personal psychology, but also by our place in the social world. Sociology’s areas of inquiry range from intimate family relationships to ties between nation-states; from divisions by race, class, gender and sexuality to shared ideas of common culture; and from understanding the influence of broad-scale social movements to analyzing how adolescents become productive adults. Sociologists help develop theories to understand how the social world works and also use analytic tools to craft policies and create programs that address important social issues, such as neighborhood and educational inequality. Few disciplines offer such a broad scope of relevance for understanding individual and collective relations in society. The substantive breadth and skills in conducting and analyzing research that sociology majors obtain can be useful for a range of career paths including: business and marketing, criminal justice, education, environment and technology, graduate school, law, public health, leadership in faith communities, non-profit and social service organizations, public policy, social welfare and social work. Students will leave the major with research skills developed in conjunction with knowledge of substantive material relevant to a variety of social service and non-profit research positions.

Literature and literary criticism are significant parts of an ages old, continuing conversation about the meaning and value of human society. Unlike scientific or social scientific approaches to this conversation, literary discourse emphasizes the particular in the dialogue between particular and universal. It always arises out of specific times, places, and cultural traditions, and it often gives powerful voice to cultural differences and individual differences against the backdrop of larger, homogenizing forces. Moreover, literature has traditionally fore-grounded questions of value over questions of definition, or rather, sees questions of value as central to the definition of humanity itself. The study of literature enables one to engage this conversation richly, both for personal development and for the ability it gives one to be a responsible agent in the many societies each person inhabits. Moreover, literary study gives one insight into how cultures operate in such a way as to facilitate ethical cross-cultural interactions. Literary study facilitates such agency by teaching readers how to understand—an understanding that engages intellectual, ethical and aesthetic faculties— and then critique literary artifacts."

In the coming decades, environmental engineers will increasingly be called upon to address broader issues of environmental sustainability by minimizing the release of residuals through altered production processes and choice of materials; by capturing the resource value of wastes through recovery, recycling and reuse; and by managing natural resources to meet competing societal objectives. UC Merced emphasizes a highly interdisciplinary approach to environmental engineering, combining a strong theoretical foundation with field studies, laboratory experiments and computational simulations. Core courses within the major provide students with a firm foundation in the physical and life sciences and the ways that they apply to energy, hydrology, and air- and water-quality issues. Emphasis areas allow students the flexibility to study in more depth by following tracks developed in consultation with their academic adviser(s). The main areas of emphasis for Environmental Engineering at UC Merced are hydrology, water quality, air pollution and sustainable energy. Hydrology focuses on the sources, balance and use of water in both natural and managed environments, including precipitation, mountain snowpack, river runoff, vegetation, water use and groundwater. Both the physical and chemical aspects of the water cycle are included. Water quality focuses on engineering solutions to water and waste issues, including measurement technology, water-quality assessments, treatment systems and remediation of contaminated waters. Physical, chemical and biological aspects are included. Air pollution and sustainable energy focus on engineering solutions to air quality and energy problems, both regionally and globally. The sources, fate, effects of air pollutants, as well as the planning and design of solar and other renewable energy systems are included. Engineers need to understand not only the technical but also the social and political contexts of their work. They must be able to communicate and plan, finance and market their products and ideas. Social sciences, business, humanities and arts courses are an important part of the curriculum. The result is a major that is hands-on and creative, engaging and adaptable.

Since the beginnings of civilization, technological progress has always relied on the materials people were able to acquire from nature, through trade or by innovation. Wood, stone, bronze, iron, steel, aluminum, cements, plastics, semiconductors, liquid crystals, nanomaterials and quantum dots all have unique properties that enable—but also limit—what humans can make and do. Nations continue to go to war over access to particular raw materials. The construction of safe dwellings, the conveniences of rapid travel, the efficiency of telecommunications, the calculating and archiving power of computers, the life prolonging gifts of surgical implants and the dazzling performances of athletes all require dependable materials. Future technological progress, of any kind, will always be driven by the available materials. Materials Science and Engineering applies fundamental principles of physics and chemistry to designing materials with desired combinations of mechanical, optical, electrical, magnetic, electrochemical and other properties. Increasingly, innovative materials are being developed with the benefit of lessons that have been learned from nature. Examples include armor based on the structure of abalone shells and rats’ teeth; optical materials that owe a debt to sea urchin spines and peacock feathers; high-performance ballistic fibers modeled on spider silk; self-cleaning surfaces copied from lotus leaves; and strong, reusable adhesives that emulate the behavior of gecko feet. Also encompassed in MSE are the methods by which particular atomic and molecular arrangements (nanostructures and microstructures) are achieved, the overall cost of the ingredients and processes used to produce particular materials, the effects of the environment on materials, the effects of materials and materials processing on the environment, and characterization of materials structure and properties. Because MSE embraces skills from physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology, it is especially appealing to anyone who enjoys interdisciplinary studies and who seeks to apply such knowledge to solving practical engineering problems. MSE graduates are in demand in a great variety of fields including manufacturing, energy, utilities, patent law, the financial sector, construction, transportation, aerospace, computer industries, sports, consulting, public policy, education and research. Employers appreciate the ability of MSE graduates to relate to colleagues across a broad spectrum of expertise.

Whether the resource that is being allocated is income, time, or a precious commodity, there is always some tradeoff associated with allocating the resource for one use and not another. Individuals, businesses, and governments face these tradeoffs in countless ways every day. The most important thing students learn from studying economics is how to identify, measure, and understand the essential elements of this tradeoff. The Economics major is built on a foundation of strong theoretical and statistical training. The major provides students solid grounding in microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, statistical and econometric methodology, as well as applied economic analysis. The Economics major emphasizes the role of incentives and institutions in shaping economic outcomes and how public policies influence economic performance and individual outcomes. Special emphases in the program include labor economics, public economics, political economy, law and economics, environmental economics, empirical methods, and U.S. economic history. In addition to having a solid understanding of economic theory, our program has a special emphasis on empirical research methods in economics. All students engage in research (with faculty, in teams, and independently) that involves analyzing data and answering well formulated questions related to public policies. With these research experiences, our students are competitive for research internships, fellowships, and pre-graduate summer programs while still in school. Because students with a degree in economics develop strong analytical and quantitative skills and the ability to solve complex problems effectively, studying economics is excellent preparation for many careers in business, law, management consulting, education, or public service. Businesses of all types and sizes, financial institutions, consulting firms, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, as well as graduate business and law schools actively seek graduates with bachelor’s degrees in economics.

The study of political institutions includes topics such as the effect of the design of electoral systems on the quality of representation in government, the formal and informal elements of the legislative process and their implications for the making of law, and the impact of domestic political institutions on the incidence of international conflict. Under the rubric of political behavior, political scientists study how and why people choose to participate in politics, the determinants of vote choice, and the nature and origins of public opinion. Students studying political science at UC Merced develop a strong substantive understanding of both political institutions and behavior. Students also learn the theories that help us better understand the political world and the methods by which these theories are tested and refined. Political Science majors choose courses from four subfields of the discipline: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Pre-Law. The study of institutions and behavior is central to all four of these subfields, although the substantive emphasis differs. Courses in American Politics focus on domestic politics in the U.S., while courses in Comparative Politics examine government and politics in other nations. International Relations classes address issues in foreign policy, international conflict, and the institutions intended to govern the interactions between nations. Pre-Law classes involve legal institutions and the behavior of legal actors. Students choose two subfields on which to focus.

The field of psychology can be both applied and theoretical, and is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing together aspects of the natural and social sciences, humanities and the arts to address specific problems. For example, research psychologists might study the functions of neurons in the brain, complex mathematical processes, how to collect and analyze data, the growth of children, health and behavioral physiology, learning in animals, psychological stress, the basis of artistic talent, evolution, sensory perception, parent-infant attachment, psychiatric disorders or any of a wide variety of other topics. The undergraduate major in Psychology provides students with an understanding of the major questions and methodologies across Psychology, including a common core of statistical and experimental methods courses. Upper division courses and projects allow students to explore the various substantive specialties in psychology, and to identify the areas of psychology that they might wish to pursue further. Many students with an undergraduate degree in psychology go on to graduate study in psychology or closely related fields such as cognitive science or organizational behavior, as well as other fields such as social work, medicine and law. The psychology program strongly encourages further graduate study, and supports its undergraduate majors in reaching this goal by providing opportunities to work with faculty on research. The Psychology major also prepares undergraduates for many other careers even without further graduate training. The American Psychological Association reports that only about 5% bachelor’s degree psychology major graduates had taken a job that is actually in psychology. This is largely because work directly in psychology typically requires a graduate degree. Most psychology major graduates—about two thirds—took employment in private sector business settings. Graduates with an undergraduate psychology major are highly marketable because they are trained to have good research and writing skills, to be effective problem solvers in both team and individual settings, and to use critical thinking skills to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information. Specific examples of employment include administrative support, public affairs, education, business, sales, service industries, health, the biological sciences, computer programming, employment counselors, correction counselor trainees, interviewers, personnel analysts, probation officers, and writers. APA also reports that two thirds of psychology major graduates believe their job is closely or somewhat related to their psychology background and that their jobs hold career potential. Students who complete the Psychology major will: Show knowledge of the key substantive content of the field of psychology, including memory and thinking, sensory psychology and physiology, developmental psychology, clinical and abnormal psychology, and social psychology; Demonstrate that they understand the basic principles of and correctly interpret applications of the designs and methods that psychologists use to gather data; Show that they can understand and correctly interpret the statistical analyses psychologists use to analyze data; Show that they understand and can apply the writing style used in psychological literature (APA style)."

Its scope covers everything from the tiniest particles of matter—such as atoms, electrons, and quarks—to the structure of the entire universe, encompassing innumerable galaxies and stars. Physicists seek to understand complex phenomena in terms of simple, unifying principles. Their queries have ranged from the seemingly innocuous, like “What causes an object to fall?” to the more elemental, like “What is the true nature of light?” Such questions led to the discovery of the gravitational force, which governs the motion of planets and stars, as well as to the biggest breakthrough of the twentieth century—quantum mechanics—which governs the very small. Answers to physicists’ questions have revolutionized society, not only altering our basic understanding of the universe, but also profoundly affecting our day-to-day lives, laying the foundation for numerous technological innovations such as the laser, computer, and cellular phone. And physics continues to evolve and excite us, with unanswered questions from a multitude of active and emerging fields of research, such as Quantum Computation, Superconductivity, Chaos, Biophysics, and String Theory, to name a few. The Physics Program at UC Merced provides a strong foundation in the fundamentals of theoretical and applied physics, while also emphasizing the increasingly interdisciplinary role played by physicists in the scientific and technological community. This is reflected in the “core plus emphasis track” model of the major. The core is a rigorous grounding in fundamental physical principles, including electricity and magnetism, quantum and classical mechanics, and thermodynamics. The emphasis tracks consist of flexible specialization options. They include, but are not limited to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) Physics; Mathematical Physics; and Biophysics. Physics students develop excellent quantitative and analytical skills, enabling them to approach new and complex problems that arise in any field. These fundamental skills are essential preparation for a wide range of careers in such fields as aerospace, biotechnology, computers, engineering, medicine, education, law, finance, business, and consulting. Students are encouraged to choose their electives to form an emphasis track in an area of physics or interdisciplinary study. The established emphasis tracks are: . Students may also propose and design their own , with the assistance of their faculty advisors. Typically, the track includes the three upper division physics electives and culminates with the student’s senior thesis ( ). A student may also choose not to participate in the track program at all, although the senior thesis and two physics electives are still degree requirements.

Literature and literary criticism are significant parts of an ages old, continuing conversation about the meaning and value of human society. Unlike scientific or social scientific approaches to this conversation, literary discourse emphasizes the particular in the dialogue between particular and universal. It always arises out of specific times, places, and cultural traditions, and it often gives powerful voice to cultural differences and individual differences against the backdrop of larger, homogenizing forces. Moreover, literature has traditionally fore-grounded questions of value over questions of definition, or rather, sees questions of value as central to the definition of humanity itself. The study of literature enables one to engage this conversation richly, both for personal development and for the ability it gives one to be a responsible agent in the many societies each person inhabits. Moreover, literary study gives one insight into how cultures operate in such a way as to facilitate ethical cross-cultural interactions. Literary study facilitates such agency by teaching readers how to understand—an understanding that engages intellectual, ethical and aesthetic faculties— and then critique literary artifacts. The program learning outcomes of the major seek to articulate, in specific ways, how the successful student majoring in English will be able participate in this larger intellectual, historical, and esthetic conversation. Students will demonstrate the ability to: Interpret texts with due sensitivity to both textual and contextual cues. Articulate an appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of texts by the standards of their times and places. Demonstrate historical, geographic, and cultural empathy by reading texts written in other times, places, and cultures. Apply interpretive strategies developed in literary study to other academic and professional contexts. Write cogently and with sensitivity to audience."

Spanish is also one of the languages most often used in California and in the Central Valley, as well as one of the four official languages of the United Nations. Beyond its relevance in the world, Spanish should also be well represented locally, since the University of California, Merced is a Hispanic Serving Institution. The major in Spanish at UC Merced will provide students with the linguistic skills and necessary cultural background to communicate their ideas in Spanish in different professional contexts, to think critically, and to analyze literary works. In doing so, the major in Spanish will help students to face the demands of an ever more globalized society, one that requires and values linguistic and cultural competence in more than one language. Most employers appreciate employees with knowledge of a second language, Spanish being one of the languages most demanded. In order to use a language in an efficient manner, the speaker should be familiar with the main social traits that define the native speakers of such a language, as well as with their cultural manifestations, literature and history. Knowledge of the particularities of the language associated with professions is also a relevant tool to relate to and work with native speakers. The program learning goals for the Spanish major describe the purpose of education in our degree unit and our vision for student enrichment. Faculty will strive to realize the following goals. Demonstrate Spanish writing and reading skills equivalent to at least the advanced-high level of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Proficiency Guidelines. Demonstrate Spanish speaking and listening skills equivalent to at least the advanced-high level of the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines.

The program has special emphases in (1) applied ethics and political philosophy, and (2) philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Students are expected to demonstrate mastery of the material they study in traditional ways, including critical written analyses and written exams, but are also expected to make use of non-traditional methods. Examples include incorporating readings from outside of the philosophy literature, conceptual analysis of non-philosophical texts (such as scientific texts and policy analyses), and in some cases computer and mathematical modeling projects. Upon graduation, we expect students minoring in philosophy to fulfill all of the following: Basic fluency in interpretation and criticism of arguments. Have the ability to independently study, summarize and criticize philosophical arguments, including arguments presented in classic texts and in contemporary philosophical literature. Ability to present and defend original arguments. Have the ability to present well-defined claims of one’s own, to give clear philosophical arguments in defense of these claims, and to respond to critical objections others might raise against these claims. Basic fluency in logical inference. Be able to distinguish between logically valid and invalid deductive arguments, be able to translate verbal statements into symbolic expressions having correct logical form, and be able to give proofs of elementary propositions of logic. Interdisciplinary applications. Be able to use philosophy in an interdisciplinary way, for example, by philosophically analyzing non-philosophical texts (e.g. texts form a literature, history, psychology, or physics course), or by using formal methodological tools, such as mathematical and computer models, in the analysis of philosophical problems. Additionally, we expect students minoring in philosophy to fulfill at least two of the following: Basic fluency in inductive logic. Be able to provide and assess evidence for causal claims and identify various fallacies in inductive reasoning (e.g. sample bias). Ability to appraise normative claims. Be able to distinguish between descriptive and normative philosophical claims, and to use certain descriptive claims either to support or to criticize certain normative claims. Historical understanding. Have an appreciation of how the discipline of philosophy has developed over time in response to internal challenges and to advances in science and changes in social life. (e.g., the renaissance in philosophy of mind was stimulated in part by the development of contemporary artificial intelligence)."

Thus, faculty in this field brings together the humanities, social sciences, policy, and management, consistent with the interdisciplinary intent of the World Cultures program within SSHA. The key feature of the program, a strong technology orientation, will permit us to create a new discipline and innovative profiles for new economics, computer science, educational purposes and many others. The challenge for our contemporary classroom work is to construct a curriculum that blends humanistic interests and technology. Students will learn that the codes, metadata, and interfaces of today are in constant change and thus the fundamental task will be to determine how to set up a sustainable management system for digital media and global heritage study. The learning outcome from such teaching should be the acquisition of a methodology aimed at understanding and communicating information about tangible and intangible heritage, cultural and natural sites. Each student in the World Heritage Program should learn to apply this methodology to the specialization of their field or to specific case studies within their field. The main task is to study the evolving technologies and methodologies of analysis, interpretation, communication and presentation of heritage sites (natural and cultural), evaluating their potential to enrich contemporary societies in the light of the reconstruction of the past. Students will be able to: Define the concept of World Heritage and explain its implications for contemporary society. Dialogue with different disciplines such as architecture, history, art history, geography, anthropology, management, cognitive science, computer science. Understand how multiple academic disciplines and methodologies contribute to World Heritage. Use integrated computer technologies to complete heritage case studies and understand the appropriate context for the use of different technologies in the heritage field.

In this endeavor, the World Cultures Graduate Group simultaneously embraces emerging trends in the scholarly world, while it harkens back to the holistic approach to knowledge common in the Renaissance. The interdisciplinary framework reconnects areas of study that have drifted apart even as their critical structures have shared basic tools and areas of inquiry, fields ranging from history and literature to art, anthropology, philosophy, and religion. Students will understand and use methods by which historians, literary scholars, anthropologists, artists, philosophers, and other humanists and social scientists examine societies and cultures. At the same time, students will critically examine theories of identity, culture, and society shared by scholars in multiple academic fields that create intellectual bridges for interdisciplinary inquiry. The World Cultures Graduate Group thus provides a broad intellectual context in which to locate societies and cultures over time and space. The objective is to train scholars who are able to work within or beyond the academy in particular disciplines and, simultaneously, to acknowledge and create interdisciplinary frameworks for study of complex human systems and constructs. The approved emphasis in World Cultures under the Individual Graduate Program (IGP) offers courses of study leading to either a Masters of Arts (M.A.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree within the IGP at UC Merced. Drawing on the expertise and interests of affiliated faculty, both M.A. and Ph.D. students develop individualized, research-based courses of study that encompass traditional seminar instruction, individual directed study, and independent research. Students may either define their research around an interdisciplinary problematic or in primarily disciplinary terms with a wider lens. Thus, the World Cultures Graduate Group offers a unique framework in which to approach core disciplines of scholarly study, one that emphasizes an understanding of how similar issues and topics are addressed in multiple fields. Become proficient in research methods appropriate to the study of world cultures. Understand and apply critique, analysis, and theory relevant to the study of world cultures. Demonstrate proficiency in world cultures research, analysis, and critique through exams, papers, and theses. Contribute new knowledge to the study of world cultures."

The physics emphasis offers individualized research-based programs of study leading to the Ph.D. degree under UC Merced’s Individual Graduate Program (IGP). While the M.S. degree is also offered, admission normally is granted only to students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. Students work closely with one or more program faculty to identify, design, and carry out an independent research project that advances knowledge in the field. UC Merced’s faculty research programs are highly interdisciplinary, with collaborative faculty working in both emerging and established research areas such as condensed matter, quantum information, solar energy, atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics, soft matter and biological physics, and nanoscience. The deadline for receipt of applications is January 15. Late applications are considered as space permits. Normally applications are accepted for Fall semester only. The minimum requirement for admission is a bachelor’s degree in physics or a related field of science or engineering with a grade point average of at least 3.0. The GRE general test is required and the subject test in physics, chemistry, or mathematics is recommended. Admission decisions are based on undergraduate grades, performance on the GRE, accomplishments in undergraduate research, and letters of recommendation. Students from non-English speaking countries must take the TOEFL exam and are normally interviewed by telephone in order to evaluate English proficiency. During the first year in residence, students typically take courses and serve as TAs for undergraduate science courses. The heart of the Physics Ph.D. program is the completion of original scientific research leading to the preparation and defense of a Ph.D. dissertation. Students are encouraged to discuss research interests and possible Ph.D. projects with all of the faculty in the group as early as possible, and select a faculty research advisor (major professor) early during the second semester of study. Research normally occupies a majority of the student’s time after the first year in residence. To complete a Ph.D. degree with an emphasis in physics at UC Merced students are required to: Complete at least four semesters of full-time academic residence (12 units minimum) at UC Merced; Complete the required courses with a letter grade of at least “B” in each course (“S” in seminar courses graded S/U); Serve as a teaching assistant for at least one semester; Pass the oral Ph.D. qualifying examination; Present and successfully defend a doctoral dissertation containing an original contribution to knowledge in the field. Possess a broad foundation in the fundamentals of physics and a deep understanding of their chosen subfield, which will permit them to understand and critically evaluate current research. Have the experimental, theoretical, and/or computational skills necessary to conduct independent responsible research and contribute to knowledge in their chosen subfield. Identify new research opportunities, which may cross traditional discipline boundaries, plan effective strategies for pursuing these opportunities and conduct research that makes a new contribution to knowledge in their chosen subfield of physics. Communicate both fundamental concepts of physics and details of their own research effectively, in written and oral form, to expert and non-expert audiences."

In this endeavor, the World Cultures Graduate Group simultaneously embraces emerging trends in the scholarly world, while it harkens back to the holistic approach to knowledge common in the Renaissance. The interdisciplinary framework reconnects areas of study that have drifted apart even as their critical structures have shared basic tools and areas of inquiry, fields ranging from history and literature to art, anthropology, philosophy, and religion. Students will understand and use methods by which historians, literary scholars, anthropologists, artists, philosophers, and other humanists and social scientists examine societies and cultures. At the same time, students will critically examine theories of identity, culture, and society shared by scholars in multiple academic fields that create intellectual bridges for interdisciplinary inquiry. The World Cultures Graduate Group thus provides a broad intellectual context in which to locate societies and cultures over time and space. The objective is to train scholars who are able to work within or beyond the academy in particular disciplines and, simultaneously, to acknowledge and create interdisciplinary frameworks for study of complex human systems and constructs. The approved emphasis in World Cultures under the Individual Graduate Program (IGP) offers courses of study leading to either a Masters of Arts (M.A.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree within the IGP at UC Merced. Drawing on the expertise and interests of affiliated faculty, both M.A. and Ph.D. students develop individualized, research-based courses of study that encompass traditional seminar instruction, individual directed study, and independent research. Students may either define their research around an interdisciplinary problematic or in primarily disciplinary terms with a wider lens. Thus, the World Cultures Graduate Group offers a unique framework in which to approach core disciplines of scholarly study, one that emphasizes an understanding of how similar issues and topics are addressed in multiple fields. Become proficient in research methods appropriate to the study of world cultures. Understand and apply critique, analysis, and theory relevant to the study of world cultures. Demonstrate proficiency in world cultures research, analysis, and critique through exams, papers, and theses. Contribute new knowledge to the study of world cultures."

The program brings together disciplines traditionally housed in different departments, including art history, visual studies, musicology and ethnomusicology, music performance, and studio art. The GASP curriculum integrates creative practice and hands-on training (ARTS 40%) with the theoretical analysis of visual, sonic, and material culture (GASP 60%). Our aim is to build an arts research program that fosters a new generation of critical thinkers with global and interdisciplinary perspectives grounded in rigorous acquisition of historical and theoretical knowledge. The program is global in many senses of the word. We study all fields of creative expression in multiple global contexts with equal rigor, from film screen to dance club, from ritual and touristic practices to museums and concert halls. Our faculty of of ethnomusicologists and art historians helps students refine the skills they need to critically engage culturally diverse media. Lecture courses, seminars, studio classes, and ensembles are designed to explore creative processes and material connections. Through working closely with faculty, our students conduct original research and acquire nuanced insights in both sonic and visual realms. Students further deepen their understanding of global arts through hands-on training in drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, music, and dance in a variety of media and cultures. GASP offers students ample opportunities to develop their professional skills through participating in community-based events, including curating exhibitions, managing the UCM Art Gallery, organizing and performing in recitals, concerts, and multimedia presentations. The planning of a GASP Major is underway, and we aim to establish the major in 2015. In the meantime, we encourage students to pursue an Global Arts Studies Program Learning Outcomes Students participating in the Global Arts Studies Program (GASP) will be able to: Describe visual and aural texts in technical and theoretical terms Become familiar with multiple schools of thoughts in art history/visual studies and/or musicology/ethnomusicology.

Thus, faculty in this field brings together the humanities, social sciences, policy, and management, consistent with the interdisciplinary intent of the World Cultures program within SSHA. The key feature of the program, a strong technology orientation, will permit us to create a new discipline and innovative profiles for new economics, computer science, educational purposes and many others. The challenge for our contemporary classroom work is to construct a curriculum that blends humanistic interests and technology. Students will learn that the codes, metadata, and interfaces of today are in constant change and thus the fundamental task will be to determine how to set up a sustainable management system for digital media and global heritage study. The learning outcome from such teaching should be the acquisition of a methodology aimed at understanding and communicating information about tangible and intangible heritage, cultural and natural sites. Each student in the World Heritage Program should learn to apply this methodology to the specialization of their field or to specific case studies within their field. The main task is to study the evolving technologies and methodologies of analysis, interpretation, communication and presentation of heritage sites (natural and cultural), evaluating their potential to enrich contemporary societies in the light of the reconstruction of the past. Students will be able to: Define the concept of World Heritage and explain its implications for contemporary society. Dialogue with different disciplines such as architecture, history, art history, geography, anthropology, management, cognitive science, computer science. Understand how multiple academic disciplines and methodologies contribute to World Heritage. Use integrated computer technologies to complete heritage case studies and understand the appropriate context for the use of different technologies in the heritage field.

In this endeavor, the World Cultures Graduate Group simultaneously embraces emerging trends in the scholarly world, while it harkens back to the holistic approach to knowledge common in the Renaissance. The interdisciplinary framework reconnects areas of study that have drifted apart even as their critical structures have shared basic tools and areas of inquiry, fields ranging from history and literature to art, anthropology, philosophy, and religion. Students will understand and use methods by which historians, literary scholars, anthropologists, artists, philosophers, and other humanists and social scientists examine societies and cultures. At the same time, students will critically examine theories of identity, culture, and society shared by scholars in multiple academic fields that create intellectual bridges for interdisciplinary inquiry. The World Cultures Graduate Group thus provides a broad intellectual context in which to locate societies and cultures over time and space. The objective is to train scholars who are able to work within or beyond the academy in particular disciplines and, simultaneously, to acknowledge and create interdisciplinary frameworks for study of complex human systems and constructs. The approved emphasis in World Cultures under the Individual Graduate Program (IGP) offers courses of study leading to either a Masters of Arts (M.A.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree within the IGP at UC Merced. Drawing on the expertise and interests of affiliated faculty, both M.A. and Ph.D. students develop individualized, research-based courses of study that encompass traditional seminar instruction, individual directed study, and independent research. Students may either define their research around an interdisciplinary problematic or in primarily disciplinary terms with a wider lens. Thus, the World Cultures Graduate Group offers a unique framework in which to approach core disciplines of scholarly study, one that emphasizes an understanding of how similar issues and topics are addressed in multiple fields. Become proficient in research methods appropriate to the study of world cultures. Understand and apply critique, analysis, and theory relevant to the study of world cultures. Demonstrate proficiency in world cultures research, analysis, and critique through exams, papers, and theses. Contribute new knowledge to the study of world cultures."

Students in the group choose one of four emphasis areas: physical chemistry, organic chemistry, chemical biology, or computational chemistry. Students are educated and must demonstrate proficiency in a particular subdiscipline, but have the opportunity to pursue research that spans multiple fields of chemistry and other disciplines if they so desire. This approach provides our students with both the rigorous training and the broad perspectives needed to address present-day scientific and technological challenges. Most students are admitted to the Chemistry and Chemical Biology program to work toward a Ph.D. degree, but applications from students whose goal is a terminal M.S. degree will be considered in special cases. The deadline for receipt of applications is January 15. Late applications are considered as space permits. Normally applications are accepted for Fall semester only. The minimum requirement admission to the Chemistry and Chemical Biology program is a bachelor’s degree in chemistry or a closely related field of science or engineering with a grade point average of at least 3.0. The GRE general test is required and the subject test in chemistry or a related field is recommended. Admission decisions are based on undergraduate grades, performance on the GRE, accomplishments in undergraduate research, and letters of recommendation. Students from non-English speaking countries must take the TOEFL exam and are normally interviewed by telephone in order to evaluate English proficiency. During the first year in residence, students typically take courses and serve as TAs for undergraduate science courses. The heart of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Ph.D. program is the completion of a piece of original scientific research leading to the preparation and defense of a Ph.D. dissertation. Students are encouraged to discuss research interests and possible Ph.D. projects with all of the faculty in the group as early as possible, and select a faculty research advisor (major professor) no later than the second semester of study. Research normally occupies a majority of the student’s time after the first year in residence.

Literature and literary criticism are significant parts of an ages old, continuing conversation about the meaning and value of human society. Unlike scientific or social scientific approaches to this conversation, literary discourse emphasizes the particular in the dialogue between particular and universal. It always arises out of specific times, places, and cultural traditions, and it often gives powerful voice to cultural differences and individual differences against the backdrop of larger, homogenizing forces. Moreover, literature has traditionally fore-grounded questions of value over questions of definition, or rather, sees questions of value as central to the definition of humanity itself. The study of literature enables one to engage this conversation richly, both for personal development and for the ability it gives one to be a responsible agent in the many societies each person inhabits. Moreover, literary study gives one insight into how cultures operate in such a way as to facilitate ethical cross-cultural interactions. Literary study facilitates such agency by teaching readers how to understand—an understanding that engages intellectual, ethical and aesthetic faculties— and then critique literary artifacts.

The following guidelines pertain to all SSHA minors: To complete any SSHA minor, students must complete a minimum of five courses, at least four of which must be upper division. All courses must be taken for a letter grade. All minor course requirements must be completed with a C- or better.

First, graduate training is grounded on a student’s access to and engagement with faculty. The small size of the program guarantees that seminar classes will be small and students will have unparalleled one-on-one faculty mentoring with respect to research, training and professional development. Second, early graduate education will not be limited to the traditional classroom setting. After the first year, students begin to apply and sharpen research skills by directly working with faculty in a required research practicum. Third, by eliminating traditional subfield boundaries, the program allows students to ask and answer cutting-edge questions that would be stifled by traditional subfield divisions. The lack of subfield barriers also encourages interdisciplinary research and allows students to interact with a mix of cognitive scientists, economists, psychologists, philosophers, and sociologists during their training.

Once a student is admitted into the Teaching Credential Option, she/he will enroll and complete two courses to receive a single subject teaching credential: Student should enroll in UGIS 303 at UC Berkeley. Apprentice Teaching meets one afternoon each week for three hours. Taught as a seminar, the course provides a supportive and collaborative environment where apprentice teachers share their experiences and successes and work through classroom challenges. One of the central components of Apprentice Teaching is the teacher inquiry project, a systematic, data-based investigation that teachers use to improve their professional practice. Instructors and peers provide guidance and feedback as apprentice teachers plan, implement, and evaluate these projects. The finished project portfolio serves as the final evaluation for the course. The course emphasizes curriculum and assessment planning, and instructional strategies to actively engage students. The course also provides a safe space in which students can “think out loud” about ideas or issues that have come up as a result of their fieldwork. The goals is to cultivate a community of practitioners that engage in supporting all members by taking on roles of active listener, creative problem solver, and critical friend. There are two ways to complete the apprentice teaching fieldwork requirement. The CalTeach program will assist students with the process of placements but students themselves will be primarily responsible for finding a student teaching or intern position, depending on which option they choose. 1) To complete this option, students must have time in their schedule to complete student teaching and the Apprentice Teaching course during their last semester at UC Merced. The student teaching placement will require approximately 2 hours per day in the classroom, plus travel and prep time; the exact timing will depend upon the schedule of the school where they are doing their student teaching placement. 2) To complete this option, students must obtain a full-time teaching job in a local public school and enroll in the Apprentice Teaching course during both semesters of their first year of teaching. This option is only available for a year-long position beginning in the Fall. Natural Sciences Education Minor with Teaching Credential Program Learning Outcomes Upon completion of the NSEC minor students will be fully prepared to enter K-12 classrooms as teachers. The students will be able to articulate what constitutes a profession of a science or mathematics teacher and will be able to demonstrate that they acquired the skills necessary to carry out responsibilities and duties of this profession. In addition, the students will be able to demonstrate their familiarity with the California educational system, its requirements, special aspects and structure as well as the intricacies of teaching in the diverse Californian classrooms. Guidelines Applying to all Natural Sciences Minors To declare a minor, students must have an overall grade-point average of 2.0 (C) or better. Students should consult an advisor in the School of Natural Sciences to officially declare the minor and plan their courses. The following guidelines must be adhered to: At least five courses, four of which must be upper division, must be taken for a letter grade. At least three of the required courses must be taken at UC Merced. Only one course may be used to satisfy two minor programs’ requirements. Only one course may be used to satisfy both a minor and a major requirement. Work for the minor must be completed within the 150 unit maximum limit for graduation. If the student’s major and minor are in different schools, the higher unit maximum will apply. Students must consult the course descriptions for prerequisites to required courses. The minor will appear on the student’s transcript."

The Interdisciplinary Humanities Graduate Group is the marquee graduate program of a single interdisciplinary department. An interdisciplinary orientation allows Interdisciplinary Humanities Graduate Group faculty and students to illuminate grand challenges, within the World at Home/At Home in the World framework, since the task of humanists, artists and anthropologists is to explain and express cultural complexity and contingency. Our brief is the human condition as it has existed at all times and at all places, and our insights apply to problems also addressed by scientists and engineers. The Interdisciplinary Humanities Graduate Group program offers courses of study leading to either a Masters of Arts (M.A.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Drawing on the expertise and interests of affiliated faculty, both M.A. and Ph.D. students develop coursework-based and research-based courses of study that encompass traditional seminar instruction and independent research. Students may either define their research around an interdisciplinary problematic or in primarily disciplinary terms with a wider lens. Thus, the Interdisciplinary Humanities Graduate Group offers a unique framework in which to approach core disciplines of scholarly study, one that emphasizes an understanding of how similar issues and topics are addressed in multiple fields. Our students address these questions using methods that include fieldwork, description, narrative, hermeneutics, qualitative and quantitative analysis, curation, and an orientation toward ethics and politics. Become proficient in selected theories and research methods appropriate to the study of the humanities. Understand and apply both disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to humanities research. Achieve domain expertise in a particular disciplinary or interdisciplinary field of the humanities. Demonstrate proficiency in research, analysis, and critique in the humanities through exams, papers, and theses."
